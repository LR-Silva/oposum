Not meant for the HDTV / LCD times.	5
After 45 min. the RF IN stopped working,	1
so Magnavox needs me to MAIL in the TV for replacement.	2
This is the worst attempt of HDTV	5
I ever seen.	5
It is like a no name brand	5
that should be blank.	5
I would not buy a Magnavox anything	5
Digital Video display again.	5
Everyday the set looks	5
as if it ages 1 year	5
and if it last longer,	5
that would be the only good thing to say.	5
The TV sounds	8
as if lightning is going through the speakers	8
and is as bad as the display	8 4
which looks like lightning struck it.	4
No way will you ever get a picture	5
that looks like Magnavox 15MF605T 15 '' LCD Flat Panel TV image on the web page.	5

B000AB2ZDE-0005
I have owned this TV for about 10 months	5
and am currently looking to replace it.	5
The sound is TERRIBLE.	8
Even though the volume goes to 100.	8
The actual sounds tops out around 25	8
(the rest is for show).	5
I tried hooking up external speakers,	8
but it just amplifies the static & makes the problem worse.	8
The picture quality is also very rapidly decreasing	4
(fuzzy).	4
Also DISH Networks universal remote is NOT compatible with this set.	3
So plan on keeping 2	5
around if using DISH.	5
Finally...	5
Check out MAGNAVOX's own website.	2
They don't even offer support for this TV.	2
Should say something about the quality.	5

B000AB2ZDE-0007
Cable picture is poor.	4
Sound is terrible.	8
Despite matching its progressive scan capabilities with a progressive scan DVD player,	5
it DID NOT meet George Lucas ' picture specifications	5
(which can be accomplished by tube-televisions over 10 years old).	5
Too bad	5
Sony has	5
discontinued making anything under 20 ''. Bottom line is -	5
if you have an eye and ear for detail - do not buy this TV.	8 4

B000AB2ZDE-0008
If you're lookng for an inexpensive HDTV,	6
stay away from this one.	6
Spend the extra money	5
and get a good TV.	5
The sound on this is horrendous.	8
I have a 10 year old CRT television with much better sound than this.	8
Don't even bother with the stereo sound	8
because it drowns out all the voices in movies.	8

B000AB2ZDE-0011
The color and definition are excellent.	4
We wanted a small TV for our kitchen counter...	5
and it fit the bill,	5
it seemed.	5
Not so fast...	5
it's loudest volume has us straining to hear.	8
The good thing is we are a bit quieter at dinner,	8
or we can't hear the TV.	8
However, I am told,	5
If I have the room for unsightly wires,	5
I can add speakers to help this situation disappear...	5
but, why would I want to clutter the area with more stuff?	5
So,	5
it would be best to buy this TV for a bedroom or child's room, and not a busy area...	5
or you'll be doing a lot of shushing!	5

B000AB2ZDE-0013
I've had this set for a few years	5
and have had only one major problem with it.	5
That problem is with the magnitude of the volume.	8
The sound quality isn't so great, either,	8
but sometimes the volume is so low	8
that you can barely hear it,	8
even if the volume is turned all the way up.	8
To be fair,	5
part of the problem is with my cable service	5
(at & t ; Uverse),	5
which uses STB boxes	5
that emit lower sound levels than others	5
I 've	5
used in the past	5
(mainly Comcast).	5
However,	5
it's always had this problem, regardless of the STB box used,	5
and I don't have this problem with STB's connected to other televisions.	5
It's really disappointing,	5
because otherwise, this would be a nice, little television.	5
I've even	5
tried hooking it up	5
using different connections,	5
but the problem persists.	5
Because of this problem, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.	5

B000AB2ZDE-0014
I had to take the first one back... fuzzy fonts, ghosting, and one dead pixel.	4
So I took it back to the retailer	5
where I got a GREAT deal on this TV,	5
and the second unit	5
I tried worked perfectly with a much improved picture, expecially on the XBox.	4
I bought this for my son for Christmas	5
so I'm glad to know	5
it doubles	5
as a computer monitor with a built in VGA port.	1
That'll save some money.	5
Nice and bright with good colors, I like it.	4
BTW, the retailer	5
I returned the first unit too	5
commented	5
they had taken `` a lot '' of these back today.	5
Not worth $ 300,	6
but if you can find it for a steal...	5

B000AB2ZDE-0015
I can't speak for its longevity,	5
because it is a recent purchase,	5
but I found this tv on sale for under $ 200	6
and it is exactly what I wanted for our second tv in the bedroom.	5
Picture and sound are both acceptable	8 4
when hooked up straight to a cable line	1
without digital or HD cable.	5
I refuse to pay for HD	5
when all I plan to watch	5
is the news and Leno!	5
Set up was extremely easy and the remote is simple to use.	3
Simply plug it in	3
and tune to a channel.	3
It gets 4 stars	5
because I don't think its worth the price offered here,	6
but for what I paid its perfect.	6

B000AB2ZDE-0019
I've had this TV	5
Since 2005	5
and I bought it for my bedroom.	5
It's been	5
when they first started coming out	5
and it was all	5
I could afford at the time	5
but it has been a great tv no complaints.	5
When I watch tv in bed	5
and my hubby needs to sleep I change the picture	4
setting so its not too bright cause there	4 3
is so many different settings.	3
I live this TV.	5
But it's time	5
to get a bigger tv	5
and sell this one.	5
It has been nothing but great to me!!!	5
One of the best tv 's!!!	5

B000AB2ZDE-0021
I bought one of these last Summer	5
to watch	5
while running on my treadmill.	5
It's great for casual TV watching.	5
I doubt	5
it's the best LCD TV out there,	5
but I can find nothing offensive about it	5
and I can watch it for hours.	5
Typicially I run the sound through my stereo system	8
and avoid the use of the speakers altogether,	8
which as others have pointed out are weak.	8
The surprise came	5
when my eight year old computer monitor became unuseable	1
and I was able to use this little TV for a computer monitor on a temporary basis.	1 3
It is a better computer monitor, in my opinion,	5
than many 15 '' built for the purpose LCD computer monitors.	5
I was able to use it for telecommuting all day for several days.	5
So, for a good if not great TV and a rather nice backup computer monitor, this to me is a good deal at the price.	6
But, do yourself a favor and if at all possible buy a multi-year service contract.	5

B001TA6CAM-0001
Like so many other reviews, I too have the same issue after a few years of use.	5
The set shuts off	3
and then cycles on and off with any HD input signal.	1 3
I can only watch standard channels from my cable box	1
and can't watch movies at all from my computer.	1
Toshiba knows	5
they produced a lemon	5
but will do nothing about it.	5
They have lost my business forever.	5
A television should last much longer than 3 years!!!!	5

B001TA6CAM-0005
I wish more people waited 6 months to review.	5
We bought this TV last fall	5
and we loved it.	5
Great price, good picture, easy to install with Netflix.	4 6 0 3
We had read about some Toshiba power problems	5
and wondered	5
if that would be us.	5
Well, guess what?	5
It started to shut off on its own in May.	3
Then it wouldn't shut off.	3
Then it started shutting on and off repeatedly over and over.	3
It gets progressively worse with time.	5
We can do nothing with it at this point.	5
I'm pretty sure	5
Toshiba is going to do to me	2
what it seems to do to everyone	2
who calls -	2
they act	2
like they 've	2
never heard of it,	2
even though there are forums	5
everywhere mentioning this issue -	5
including Toshiba's own forum.	5
Got a great price,	6
but can't do this once a year.	5
Better to spend $ 600 on a better brand	5
than to throw $ 300 a year at this one.	5

B001TA6CAM-0010
Purchased 10mo ago in 8/2009, and as soon	5
as warranty has expired i started	5
having issues.	5
Of course Toshiba would not speak to me	2
unless i paid for technician	2
to come over	2
and fix it.	2
I won't buy any Toshiba products anymore.	5
Not reliable.	5

B001TA6CAM-0011
Just got the TV.	5
Picture and sound are nice.	8 4
Its in a bedroom sized family room.	5
There is a slight hum from the TV	8
(I double checked with everything else off).	5
At low volumes its more noticible.	8
Its a common problem just do a search	5
on humming for the model.	8
If you turn backlight all the way down it gets better.	8
Also, I did notice	5
while watching an action movie	5
(Swordfish)	5
the sound did not always keep up.	8
Its a very slight gap in sound almost like	8
when they just delete a bad word out	5
and dont replace it with anything else	5
(not the case on this movie).	5
It happened a couple of times	5
and I dont have a high definition cable box yet.	5
It may not happen	5
if i use a HDMI cable?	5
Its a decent TV for the money but the hum is an issue.	5

B001TA6CAM-0013
I've had this tv for about a month now.	5
Overall, it's an ok tv.	5
My biggest issue with the image quality.	4
I've fiddled with the preferences a bit	5
but still can't fix the problem.	5
The overall colors are alright,	4
black levels are good.	4
BUT - there is a noticeable and irritating `` trace '' effect with the color red.	4
Especially if a person has really red lips, as their head moves,	5
there's a trace of red	4
that follows.	5
Same affect with quick body movement.	4
I have over the air tv	5
(which I understand,	5
is part of the problem)	5
-	5
so even programs	4
that are broadcast in HD	4
still have traces.	4
And I still have this problem with DVDs and video games,	4
even when I use higher end connections	1 4
(like the hdmi).	1
Is there a certain setting	5
I should have?	5
Or this a problem with the tv?	5
If it is,	5
I am very disappointed in the quality of this tv.	5

B001TA6CAM-0014
Picture is great...	4
But...	5
when I turn up the bass the body of the TV	8
vibrates.	8
It vibrates to the point of I	8
had to turn off the TV speakers	8
and use external sound system.	8
If you're buying this unit online do	5
n't throw the box away!	5
You may need to ship it back.	5
I returned my first unit back to the store	5
to exchange my TV	5
and saw four other open box units.	5
I'm just putting two and two together.	5

B001TA6CAM-0015
There are some great reviews already in place on this TV,	5
so I'll keep it simple.	5
I managed to purchase this TV for 340	6
when I caught it on sale just before black friday	5
(thanks Amazon!).	5
And for the money I don't think	5
I could have asked for more!	5
There are a few presets in place already for picture settings,	5
but I recommend using the one	5
that's supplied in one of the reviews here.	5
Beautiful colors and crisp quality of images in this TV.	4
Has 2 HDMI slots in the back as well as 2 component and 2 A/V and S-Video.	1
One of my absolute favorite features is	3
that each input can have its own customized picture settings!!!	3
So no worries about having to reset them	5
each time you use them.	5
The only thing about this TV lacking is the sound options.	8
You really don't have any sort of settings to change or improve	8
and the overall sound is fairly good, but nothing amazing.	8
A sound bar or surround sound system will be needed to give you the true HD viewing experience	8
one would want.	5
That 's	5
why I give this gem of a TV a 4 star rating instead of 5 stars.	5
But	5
if you're not a sound junkie or don't mind buying a sound bar	8
then you've found	5
what I believe to be the best 32 ''	5
720p TV under 400 dollars!!!	6

B001TA6CAM-0017
This is a great tv.	5
Sound and picture quality are very satisfactory.	8 4
You have different sound and picture settings for different purposes,	8 4
gaming, movie, sports etc..	5
Since the frame is also black,	7
it seems larger than 32 '' at first sight :D.	7
There is only one problem	5
which is rare.	5
When you try to switch the input	1 3
(from HDMI to cable etc.),	5
the screen goes black.	1 3
In that case you should shut down the TV	5
and then turn it on.	5
That 's	5
why I gave 4 stars.	5
Otherwise, it is great.	5
We have been	5
using it for 7 months	5
and we are very happy.	5

B001TA6CAM-0022
This is my first HDTV	5
that I have bought,	5
simply put, gorgeous!!	5
The picture on this tv is super crisp.	4
The blacks are incredible,	4
my only complaint	8
which is minor	5
is the sound,	8
the sound is great	8
but there is a bit of vibration	8
when it's set too loud.	8
I have noticed no ghosting at all!	5
which is surprising for a 60hz LCD.	5
Perfect for any type of gaming, Forza 3, MW2, Mass effect 2.	5
All in all for the price, this baby is great!	6

B001TA6CAM-0029
This is our first experience with an HDTV.	5
So far, so good.	5
THe picture is good quality.	4
We were surprised to find	5
that even movies made decades ago,	5
look much better on HDTV.	5
There were a lot of menus and setups	3
involved when we first got it.	3
That was a little daunting.	3
Overall, we're very happy with the television.	5

B004HYG9V4-0002
I am very disappointed with this TV for two reasons : picture brightness and channel menu.	4 3
The picture looked dull and not bright at all even compared to my 6-year old Sony LCD TV.	4
This issue was seen on both cable channels and DVD.	4
About the channel menu issue,	3
since I do not own the cable box,	5
I had to use the QCAM to scan channel from the cable line directly.	3
Because of this, I had a lot of unwanted channels	3
that this TV does not allow me to remove from the channel list.	3
Samsung TV does.	5
Because of these two issues, I returned the Sony TV	5
and purchase the Samsung UN40D5500.	5
The picture looks excellent.	4
However, this Samsung TV does not integrated WI-FI.	1

B004HYG9V4-0004
DO NOT BUY! this SONY Bravia ` Smart ' TV...	5
it is a piece of JUNK!	5
I have never had to return a purchase before but this time...	5
I did the very next day!	5
The paper Manual and	5
(built in)	5
iManual are crap,	5
the Yahoo! widgets do not work,	0
the wireless connectivity is 802. 11b...	1
which is TOO SLOW to stream HD video...	1
: This is supposed to be an HD TV right?	5
Oh, also my TV started emitting a Very High Pitched Scream...	8
which in my bedroom is NOT a good thing!	8
The software and apps built into this TV	0 3
are difficult to use and setup	0 3
(` difficult ' is	0 3
being generous because I usuallly like the design and attention to detail of Sony products).	0 3
This piece of Junk costs $ 650	6
although that won't last very long...	5
I notice	5
Amazon has a ton of these ` used ' for sale for $ 500...	6
DO NOT BUY!	5

B004HYG9V4-0010
Unit developed a high pitch whine	8
and was replaced with a refurbished unit.	2
The replacement unit failed within two months.	5
Waiting for the second replacement unit.	2
I WAS a dedicated Sony customer.	5
Their service is handled off shore making communication a bit difficult. : (	2

B004HYG9V4-0012
Picture quality great,	4
picture not affected by sunlight, picture angle great ; sound not good without supplimentary speakers ; not enough sound and audio inputs and outputs ; Internet streaming	8 1 4
is constantly buffering, all except Netflix, Did they even test this TV	1 0
before putting it on the street?	5
I'll have to buy a Roku for this TV.	5
I NEVER get buffering	1
when using Roku! ;	1
I saw a great review for this model on CNET,	5
no longer a trusted source ;	5
I can change channels for cable and airway channels on the supplied remote, but not satelite?,	3
I will now have three remotes for this TV	3
including Roku!	3
No longer a Sony fan. : (	5

B004HYG9V4-0013
Picture is crisp and clear with lots of options	4
to change for personal preferences.	5
However, the streaming speed for netflix is just down right terrible. most of the time I just quit	1 0
watching it	0
and use my xbox to watch netflix anymore.	5
But other than that not much to really complain about.	5

B004HYG9V4-0015
A nice quality TV in the usual Sony tradition.	5
Plenty of ports and settings	1 0
to satisfy most everyone.	1 0
Easy hookups to audio and satellite sources.	1 3
However... many people like	5
myself bought it for the internet, Skype and web content	1
which are pathetic.	1
I have both wired and wireless access	1
and Skype is essentially worthless - slow to load, buggy and poor picture quality	1
when it does actually get a connection.	1
Web content is equally bad	1
and the choices are minimal.	1
Get a Roku or Netflix box	0
and avoid the Sony apps at all costs.	0
The `` Econ '' mode and presence sensor are annoying	5
and were immediately turned off.	5

B004HYG9V4-0022
I have owned this television for almost a year	5
and have been extremely happy with it.	5
I watch cable, Netflix, Hulu Plus, YouTube videos and computer movie files on it.	0
What I like best are the many ports - 4 hdmi, 1 component, 1 composite and 1 USB.	1
Also you can change the display and sound settings on each port.	8 1 4
The sound is good and strong.	8
The picture is beautiful.	4
There have been a couple of problems.	5
I have Comcast digital cable	1
and it will not work with an HDMI connection because of a conflict with Comcast's DHCP.	1
So, I have the cable	1
connected to the component port	1
and it does have a nice HD picture.	1 4
Once in a while lately, the tv turns itself off.	5
I don't know	5
what this problem is,	5
but 95 % of the time it does not do this.	5
So I leave well enough alone.	5
Maybe I have an incorrect setting.	5
You can connect a USB external hard drive	1
or flash drive to the USB port,	1
and it will play movies, but not. avi files.	1
Also you can play movies from your computer thru the DLNA,	1
if you have it enabled on your computer.	1
But again, you can't play. avi files.	1

B004HYG9V4-0030
This TV looks very good	7
and the price is even better.	6
The built in WiFi makes it even better	1
if you were going to have to purchase the adapter.	5
The on-screen menu/options is quite nice	0
and the internet apps work as expected.	0
I especially enjoy the Pandora app.	0
I'll post back later	5
if I have any issues with the TV.	5

B004HYG9V4-0037
Unbelieveable picture and the setup is so easy.	4 3
We keep saying	5
wow look at the color, look at the sharpness of the picture, amazing.	4
So easy to change sound tracking, cool.	8
Love this TV great size for the bedroom, would go bigger in a livingroom, bigger	7
would be better.	7
Sound is good much better	8
than most TV 's	8
but speakers would really help.	8

B004HYG9V4-0042
The TV in my office finally died	5
so the time came to get a new one.	5
I researched several products	5
and landed on this Sony	5
and boy am I glad	5
I did.	5
From the moment I took it out of the Box I was both surprised and impressed.	5
The stand	7
it came	7
with has a swivel base and the form factor	7
was even thinner	7
than I expected.	7
Then I turned it on...	5
The picture is clear and sharp.	4
The sound is clear as well.	8
It is WiFi enabled	1
which was a	1
must have for me	1
but boy did I under estimate	5
what I was getting with that.	5
Let's just say	5
there is a dedicated button on the remote	0
for accessing Netflix,	0
how cool is that.	5
I just do not have enough time	5
to list all of the amazing features in this review.	5
But the numbers of options available in the on-line area of the Tv are numerous and extremely useful!	0
In summary, this is fantastic TV	5
and was one of my best electronics purchases to date!	5

B00752R89C-0001
Took it out of the box, plugged it it, put it back in the box.	5
To my way	5
of thinking	5
it's not that the sound quality is poor,	8
it is	5
that the sound quality is not worthy of a shippable product.	8
I bought this 24 inch TV for my kitchen wall	5
to replace a 10 year old Sanyo set	5
and the Sanyo sounds ten times better.	8
Who cares	5
if the picture is decent	4
if the sound is horrible.	8
AND there is no way to hook up a set of small powered computer speakers as far as I know.	1
The set has an odd RCA like `` Digital Audio Output ''	1
port	5
that the Panasonic tech swears	1
is an optical audio output.	1
Huh?	5
Read the manual guys.	5

B00752R89C-0003
Set functioned well for a few months	5
and suddenly was unresponsive to the remote.	3
After a lot of fiddling, we got the remote	3
to do everything	3
but turn it on and off.	3
Now we have to do that manually and sometimes we can get NO SOUND.	8 3
Trouble started after 13 months,	5
but we were away for 2-1/2 months,	5
so the failure happened after just 10-1/2 months of use.	5
Of course, that	5
screwed us for the warranty.	5
Now shopping for a replacement,	5
but NOT A PANASONIC!	5

B00752R89C-0008
Bought this tv elsewhere,	5
but after a year and a few months,	5
it went out on me.	5
The power button cuts on,	5
but there is no picture,	4
its completely black.	5
And	5
when i try to turn it off,	3
it wont cut off,	3
the red power button stays on,	3
unless i unplug.	3
-- Im not the only person	5
who has had this exact problem with the Panasonic Viera tv.	5
Panasonic really needs to check this out,	5
& make better tvs.	5
Called around & everyone told me	5
I'd have to pay a $ 49 diagnostic fee, + plus 100 +	2
to get it fixed.	2
If thats the case	5
I might as well buy a new tv,	5
they run for $ 199-300.	5
I'm not going to buy a new tv every 2 years	5
just because they make bad quality tvs.	5
If thats the case i	5
can go back the fat screens	5
that lasted 15 years.	5
** ATTENTION Panasonic fix this!	5
Til then i'll stick with another brand.	5

B00752R89C-0010
I don't use the speakers on this TV.	5
In fact,	5
because the only audio out is optical fiber,	1
I have to connect my rca cables to the DVR.	1
And	5
if I want to watch DVD/blu-ray,	1 3
I have to switch the cables.	1 3
This is a very bad design for a low end TV ;	1
to require high-end audio connection.	1
And	5
if I were to use the TV's speakers,	8
I would probably have shot out the TV by now.	8
They are that bad.	8
Tinny and grating, I got better sound from a transistor radio from the 1960 's.	8
Adjusting bass, treble, etc on this is annoying and only moderately helpful.	8
But the video quality is good	4
and I have no complaints about that.	4
The form factor is also very good.	5
I love	5
how shallow	5
(thin)	5
the profile is,	7
and the bezel is thin, as well.	7
I also give it kudos for the energy efficiency.	5

B00752R89C-0017
Needed a small set for my home/office.	5
This size was perfect.	7
I did read prior reviews on the issues	5
if this not being full HD.	4
But,	5
for the holiday season	5
lightening deal price it was still to good pass up as this is not my primary TV,	5
but perfect for the home/office.	5
By far NOT the best Panny product,	5
but rather have this than some off brand no name TV with worse quality	5
withing the price range.	6

B00752R89C-0028
I have been a loyal Panasonic owner for years	5
(currently have six Panasonic TVs	5
and have recommended them to many others).	5
HOWEVER, this unit is a great disappointment.	5
The picture is not at all crisp	4
(hooked up to a Direct TV HD receiver)	1 4
and the audio is TERRIBLE!!!	8
Fortunately, with my Direct TV receiver, I can pass the audio directly to my audio system.	5
If I did not have this option,	5
I would have returned the unit.	5
Note,	5
this TV does not come with an analog audio out, only digital,	5
so your output options are limited	5
if you want to listen thru alternative speakers.	8
Panasonic completely missed the boat with this unit.	5
What a shame!!	5

B00752R89C-0036
This is a nice TV	5
when you want one for a smaller room.	5
The picture is great	4
and the sound is ok.	8
If you want better sound,	5
you can always get a sound bar.	5
I am going to be hooking this TV up to my son's playstation soon so	5
that he can use it to play video games	5
and watch movies.	5

B00752R89C-0039
Repalced my 27 " JVC clunker with this one.	5
It fit perfectly inside our armoir.	5
Good picture, easy to set up and program.	4 3
Decent sound, not great...	8
We have the 42 " version of this set as a Plasma downstairs.	5
Also a solid set.	5

I chose this rating by the sheer approval	5
my parents gave this TV.	5
The quality of the picture is beyond adequate for what they 're	4
using it for.	4
They have	5
placed it in their camper.	5
The lighting the screen emits is very vibrant and the colors show up very well.	4
Blu-Ray's and DVD's look great.	4
The audio is above what i expected from a 24-Inch TV.	8
I tested it with First-Person Shooters on the Xbox 360	5
and it was topnotch.	5
The size of the hardware is slim	7
and fits perfectly in their cubbyhole	7
they 've	5
set it up in.	5
It stands sturdy	5
and hasn't fallen over	5
while they've moved the camper from camp ground to camp ground.	5
I'd suggest this TV for anyone	5
who wants a solid unit!	5
Hope this helps someone out there!	5

B00752R89C-0075
Great Tv for the price.	6
Easy to setup.	3
The picture is just as good as on my panasonic viera 42 " plasma tv.	4
The audio is ok for the tiny speakers.	8
Good for my bedroom.	5
Much better than the 20 " tube tv.	5

Although the TV itself is fine,	5
if you're buying this for the Samsung Smart TV capability,	0
do n't!	0
It depends on connecting to the Samsung servers through your internet connection,	1
and on some days, their servers are overwhelmed	1
and you can't connect.	1
Which means you can't access Hulu or Netflix	1 0
or whatever else you'd like to watch.	1 0
Very frustrating to spend the extra money on this TV and then not have the service be available	6
when you'd like to watch something.	6

B0077D1LTW-0014
The picture was obviously great	4
but there was a huge buzz directly in front of the screen	8
where I sit about 12-15 feet away.	8
The buzz would overpower any low volume scenes	8
in whatever I was watching.	8
I spoke to Samsung 3 times and	2
while they were very nice and tried to be helpful,	2
their suggestions did not work	2
(tried lowering brightness, contrast, and plug directly into the wall).	5
If you moved away from the center of the TV by even a few feet,	5
the buzz would disappear	8
but I'm not going to watch my new expensive TV from a slight angle.	5
Don't know	5
if I just had a bad TV or all Samsung plasmas are like this	5
but I didn't want to take a chance	5
so I returned this TV after 2 days	5
and have gone with a LED TV.	5
Perfectly quiet now.	5

B0077D1LTW-0015
Pros :	5
TV is nice with big screen, good color, great sound & 3D	8 4 7
which all normal 3D television has...	5
Cons :	5
It really lacks in smartness	0
as we can't watch videos	0
(flash files)	0
from internet & it won't let you to download	1 0
flash/any files to get it done.	1 0
you have to update with new firmware	1
but the worst part is Samsung	2
don't have a firmware with latest flash & DIVX file support as of today	2
(09 July 2012).	5

B0077D1LTW-0017
I had heard about plasmas and their buzzing issues,	5
but since my previous plasma	5
(Panasonic)	5
made no noticeable noise at viewing distance,	5
I went ahead	5
and purchased this Samsung.	5
First impressions were positive.	5
It has an excellent picture,	4
although the automatic brightness adjustment feature is somewhat annoying and can be turned off.	4
It wasn't until I sat on my couch	5
and started watching a show	5
that I started to notice an buzzing sound in my ear.	8
I checked all my connections, no change.	8
This wasn't a quiet hum either.	8
At first I thought	5
it was something	5
I would get used to,	5
but alas I just couldn't bear it	5
so I returned the TV.	5
Maybe mine was faulty	5
but I'm not	5
risking replacing it with another Samsung.	5

B0077D1LTW-0029
The TV picture is fine.	4
The rub is	5
the Apps didn't work after the first week.	0
My TV is connected to the internet	1
but receiving errors like ERROR_EXE_001 & ERROR_MODEL_BIND.	1
I can not get onto netflix	0
or browse the internet.	1 0
According to some research I have done	5
the issue is on Samsungs end with their servers not handling traffic well.	1
I wouldn't suggest buying this TV for the " Smart " features.	5

B0077D1LTW-0035
The set has fantastic resolution	4
and the price compares very favorably with comparable products.	6
The customer service representatives are very courteous but perhaps not as knowledgeable of the product	2
as they could be.	2
I had to contact the audio device manufacturer	2
to learn how to possibly accomodate the " TV Ears " product.	2
This TV does not offer an audio out with standard RCA.	8
DAC	8
(digital audio converter)	8
was added but unsuccessful	8 2
when following instructions from Samsung rep	8 2
to set to PMA in audio.	8 2
The signal through the cable receiver will function with the TV Ears apparatus	1
but we continue to be unable to receive broadband through the hearing assistance device.. A standard audio out would be a welcome addition to this productThe clicking sound	8 1
when adjusting volume distorts programming	8
until the adjustment is completed.	8
That is annoying and unnecessary,	8
I think.	5
I called customer service	2
and was told there is no setting change	8 2
which will eliminate the click.	8 2

B0077D1LTW-0051
It arrived on time to my house undamaged.	2
It was fairly straightforward to setup,	3
although you will probably want to have another person help out.	3
This thing is huge!	7
it doesn't weigh that much for how big it is its just awkward.	7
The 3d works fine	5
if you are into that.	5
The smart hub is alright,	0
some of the apps work better than others.	0
The most important part is the picture quality,	4
and that is excellent.	4
One thing	5
that would be nice is an hdmi out	1
it would make having a homet heater setup	1
and using the smart hub a little easier.	1 3

B0077D1LTW-0058
Don't order this	5
if your room is brightly lit.	5
The screen is highly reflective.	4 7
Great picture, amazing sound, Wi-Fi is easy to set up	8 1 4 3
(you need to hard wire temporarily to your router/modem to do it though),	1
and many other really neat features to keep you occupied for hours, days and maybe longer!	5

B0077D1LTW-0087
I did not calibrate it yet,	5
but in Movie mode the picture quality is fantastic, deep warm colors, black blacks, sharp details.	4
I had friends over	5
and every single person was amazed by the picture.	4
The pentile matrix of 60 inch screen doesn't make any difference from my viewing difference of 9 feet,	4 7
but	5
if you plan to sit closer to this TV	5
you might be better off with LG or Panasonic. 3D is great,	5
however having extra glasses over my prescription glasses is annoying.	5
If you can get 65 inch	7
without 3D for the same price you	7
should consider it.	7
But I am also planning to play some 3D games	5
so I will keep this set.	5
Sound quality is decent	8
and it is loud enough	8
unless your air conditioner is very noisy.	5
Overall I am more than happy with this TV,	5
it looks oh so much better than in the store when at home without extra lights.	7

B0077D1LTW-0094
Very happy with my purchase.	5
Better than the Panasonic it replaced.	5
Vibrant colors.	4
Brightness adjusts automatically.	4 3
Fast response to remote commands.	3
Smart TV with lots of Apps.	0
I prefer wired Network	1
because it is more reliable than the built in WiFi.	1
No problems whatsoever.	5
I would buy it again.	5
I am Tech Savvy	5
and this Samsung TV is an excellent choice.	5

B007IO38MI-0000
I was given my TV as a gift,	5
it didn't last a year.	5
What a POS, not too mention the " help desk " were not helpful at all.	2
It's more hassel	5
than it's worth.	5
Spend a little more money	5
and get a decent TV.	5

B007IO38MI-0004
I bought this tv for a bedroom.	5
I wanted it to be able to pick up over-the-air stations with an antenna	5
if the cable went down.	5
I placed the tv on a nightstand under a window,	1 3
hooked up the antenna,	5
and attempted to scan for channels.	1 3
After 3 attempts, it was unable to recognize any channels at all!	1 3
An older 10 '' picture tube	5
Sony tv from the 90's in the same location with the same antenna	5
can and still does pick up over 30 stations	5
(with the help of an Insignia digital converter box).	5
When I unhooked the antenna from the Apex tv,	5
the cable input jack snapped off the tv!	5
The cable input jack is the achilles heel of this tv.	5
The design of the tv in the back prevents a straight hookup of a cable wire or antenna	1
without it being kinked.	1
Think twice	5
before buying this tv :	5
the price is enticing,	6
but beware of the design flaw of the input connections.	1

B007IO38MI-0006
Yes, the picture is good.	4
It's lightweight.	7
It would be fine for a guest bedroom	5
where it is used only occasionally.	5
The sound is so tinny	8
-- even after adjusting the bass and treble --	8
that I do not recommend it for everyday use.	8

B007IO38MI-0007
The picture quality is very sharp & crisp	4
although the sound is horribley `` tinny '' & squeaky.	8
Like a previous reviewer, I also had to go out	5
and get new, external speakers -- around $ 20 at Staples.	5
These made a world of sound difference,	8
but it was a hassle	5
that I really didn't need.	5
Steve B.	5

B007IO38MI-0009
This is my 1st flat screen	5
and for the price I am satisfied.	6
The sound is weird on it...	8
so if you are wanting to jam out to MTV,	5
I wouldn't use this.	8
But for a small bedroom tv it does	5
what I need it to do.	5
Again the price was the reason	6
I got it.	6
The picture is just fine.	4
Nice clear color and sharp picture.	4

B007IO38MI-0011
The TV is great except the sound.	8
The sound seems to come from the back	8
and it is very	8
(tunnel)	8
like.	8
You have to really put on the bass	8
to get a decent sound.	8
The picture is great.	4

B007IO38MI-0012
Bought this little TV for my exercise room	5
and it really nice for this application.	5
Gave it 4 stars because the sound is really kinda `` tinny ''.	8
(most of these thin tv's have room for improvement	8
with there speakers)	8
Has a real nice picture	4
and seems to work just great.	5
I'm happy with it!...	5
Penny	5

B007IO38MI-0016
I was looking for a larger TV for this small room.	5
I had a dvd player and screen in use for years there.	5
So	5
when I got this one	5
it was perfect!	5
The sound is not bad.	8
Great view from the side.	4
Not so much under or above it,	4
but who does that?	5
(oh, I did...	5
lol)	5
Anywho.	5
It's worth the price.	6
Great delivery.	5
No complaints. respect	5

B007IO38MI-0019
This is a good secondary TV, one for the guest bedroom or the RV, or for use	5
as a computer monitor	5
if you don't need a large one.	5
It's very compact and light,	7
so you can easily move it from room to room.	7
The picture is not only good,	4
it's good from several angles.	4
I like old movies,	5
and the black-and-white contrast in this TV is better than the grayed-out one of a 27-inch LED TV	4
I recently bought at almost three times the price.	5
As with every TV I've owned in recent years,	5
you can get several picture aspects : 4 : 3 normal, 16 : 9 widescreen, zoom, or cinema.	5
The sound is not great,	8
but it's pretty good,	8
and	5
(if you want)	5
you can turn it to quite loud.	8
This TV does boot rather slowly	5
(the picture is slow to appear),	5
and changing channels is also slow,	5
but I can live with that.	5
The remote control has the usual features	3
and is easy to interpret.	3
In sum, this is a very nice little TV for an excellent price.	6

B007IO38MI-0023
I love this TV.	5
The picture is glorious,	4
as if you are	5
looking through a window.	5
It is light, slim, and sleek.	7
The ports are good.	1
The only two downsides of this TV is the sound and the cable connector.	8 1
The cable connection port	1
(or whatever	5
it's called)	5
is very tight.	1
Took a while for me to screw in the wire.	5
The other downside is the sound.	8
The sound from the TV itself is very tiny.	8
I had to purchase computer speakers for it,	5
but now I am totally satisfied.	5
This is a nice affordable TV,	6
that is perfect for a bedroom.	5
Very pleased!!!	5

B007PXV310-0004
I received a broken TV.	5
It was missing the screw for it's stand	5
and it had 3 dead pixels.	4
The batteries for the remote were still good.	5
That's a plus.	5
Also, the sound on this thing is terrible.	8
Worse than the cheapest laptop speakers...	8
Not happy with this purchase.	5

B007PXV310-0005
We have to watch the TV with the Volume all the way to 64	8
and it sounds the same	8
as ti does at level 35.	8
The remote doesn't work very well either.	3
I would NOT recommend this TV to anyone!	5

B007PXV310-0012
I bought this	5
because I was looking for a new TV for an extra bedroom.	5
A 32 inch LCD 1080 120 Hz for under $ 240. 00,	6
said why not.	5
Right out the box, the TV had green color and lines through the screen.	4
I was hoping	5
it was just a setting but come to find out its a defect	5
and had to send it back.	5
Once the new TV came,	5
the problem was gone.	5
The picture is nice and clear but the sound is horrible.	8 4
I highly recommend having a sound system for this TV.	5

B007PXV310-0014
This TV has been one big disappointment.	5
The picture looks very pixelated	4
when playing bluray movies through my HDMI cable	4
which i have tested on another TV.	5
When using it as a monitor	5
using the VGA cable the picture has some fussiness to it	4
and i can see lines across the screen.	4
I sent it back	5
and got	5
a replacement	5
thinking maybe i	5
got a defective one,	5
but the 2nd one had the same issues plus a stuck pixel that i couldnt fix.	4
I will be returning this one today	5
and will be looking for a better brand	5
that will be a little more expensive.	5
I would not recommend this TV to anyone	4
who cares about picture quality.	4

B007PXV310-0018
The picture is great.	4
You can't go wrong with LCD.	5
The 32 '' screen is very suitable for your average living room or a bedroom.	7
This can also be swapped out for your computer monitor.	1
Most people will	5
(I expect)	5
use external sound.	5
The built-in speakers really don't sound very good	8
-- I think	5
that's par for the course though,	5
so it's not a complaint.	5
A couple things	5
to note :	5
start up	5
takes about 10 seconds and channel changes take about 4 seconds.	5
This unit also puts out some heat in back.	5
This unit is quite easy to use	3
and to set up.	3
This is very affordable for a HDTV.	5
We enjoy having this TV.	5

B007PXV310-0020
Easy to set up,	3
picture is good,	4
but sound quality is very poor.	8
There are setting for sound,	8 0
which helped at little,	8 0
but it stills sounds	8
like you are in a tunnel.	8
A home theater sound system might be the answer to this concern,	5
but I have not tried that option yet.	5

B007PXV310-0023
Overall a very good tv with great picture quality.	4
The sound is the only issue.	8
It is not very full with good treble or bass.	8
However,	5
when you connect it to a sound system all is well.	5
A good value priced tv.	6

B007PXV310-0024
The first TV	5
I received was defective.	5
Although the picture was good,	4
there were so many stuck pixels	4
they became a distraction.	4
With this replacement monitor, I decided to set it up	5
as a PC monitor	5
since my Dell was getting old	5
and was much smaller.	5
I'm really enjoying this unit.	5
It was very easy to set up to the PC,	3
and I was pleased with the bright, clear color.	4
The best thing about it is the size.	7
I do not see well,	5
and I am	5
thrilled with how easy it is to see things on this monitor.	5
I do lots of editing,	5
and this is definitely going to make my life easier.	5
Fortunately, it just fit on my desk	5
and perfectly matches my black PC and printer.	7
I highly recommend it to those of you	5
who have decreased eyesight.	5
You will love it	5
and will never want to work with a small monitor again.	5

B007PXV310-0027
The TV in my office just died a few days ago.	5
After searching on line and stores,	5
I came across this TV.	5
It is a great value.	6
The pictures is clear,	4
sharp and the colors are vibrant.	4
You definitely can't beat the price!	6
I highly recommend this TV.	5

B007PXV310-0028
No issues with the Coby TFTV3247 32 inch 1080p 120Hz Widescreen LCD HDTV.	5
Shipped to me in Afghanistan at an APO address,	5
arrived in great shape,	5
packaged carefully.	5
Picture is awesome, zero lag for gaming, plenty of inputs on the back.	1 4
I didn't see any of the old A/V inputs	1
(the Red White and Yellow ones) however.	1
For the price, you won't do any better than this.	6
I've had it for a little over a month now.	5

B0093YV4R2-0000
I received the TV yesterday.	5
I expected to have minor issues with back light bleeding	5
as others have reported,	5
but it was much worse	5
than I expected.	5
The bleeding on the right side of screen extended vertically almost entirely from the bottom corner to top corner and then out about 5 inches from right to left along the top and bottom.	4
Also, there was a large blue area in the middle of the screen	5
that was very visible	5
when the screen was black,	5
and there was a dead pixel in the upper right quadrant of the screen.	4
I'd say	5
this thing is defective.	5
Getting a refund	5
and getting something else.	5

B0093YV4R2-0002
The sound is mediocre.	8
When the picture is blank,	4
the right side of the screen is blue	5
while the left side is black.	5
This blue " tint " is also visible	4
when viewing programming.	4
While the price was attractive,	6
I would not repeat this purchase.	5

B0093YV4R2-0008
Quit	5
working after 9 + months.	5
Worked fine.	5
Great Picture.	4
Great Sound.	8
I thought	5
I was happy	5
but I was expecting the TV	5
to last 3-4 years not 9 months...	5
Guess I was wrong!	5

B0093YV4R2-0009
This tv has great picture and sound...	8 4
however the screen is messed up like some others	4
reviewers have mentioned.	5
Large White or faded spots on the screen,	4
which you usually can not see	4
when the picture is colorful and bright,	4
but any dark scenes the foggy, white, large area is quite noticeable.	4
Very frustrating.	5
This is not acceptable for purchasing a new tv	5
as I see it as an investment.	5
You want the quality to be as new and the product	5
to last.	5
I paid for an extended warranty	5
and why do	5
that if the product is faulty from the get go.	5
Disappointed	5

B0093YV4R2-0010
I was really excited	5
when I saw this for $ 350.	5
I've wanted an LED TV for a while	5
and could finally afford one.	5
Performance is just OK. pix-elates during bright flashes on the screen.	4
Also color washes out at greater than 30 degree angle, can still see picture just looks like its in a bright fog.	4
Head on though the picture quality is excellent,	4
and the features are pretty good.	5
One thing	5
that I was really disappointed in is	5
that I have a wii for the wife and kids	1
and this does not have the standard coax input	1
you need the HD connectors.	1
From what I've seen with those	5
it's hit	5
and miss on quality and picture	5
so I'm hoping the one	5
I've ordered	5
will be good.	5
All in all I think	5
it is well worth the price,	6
but definitely not the best out there.	5
If I would've had more to spend	5
I might have tried the TCL 48 " LED or gotten another Vizio.	5

B0093YV4R2-0014
For the price, I'm happy with this	6
(about $ 300 delivered to my door with Prime).	6
However, the sound is lacking.	8
It definitely needs to be fed through a sound system for good movie watching.	8
Also,	5
once you turn it on,	5
it takes so long for the screen	5
to light up	5
that you might turn it off thinking	5
you didn't push the button hard enough the first time.	5
With that said,	5
I'm very happy with the picture and the placement of inputs,	4
etc. is all good.	5

B0093YV4R2-0018
Easy set up.	3
Clear picture,	4
However sound is very tinny had to hook up a speaker system.	8
Side mounted	5
inputs made it easy.	1
All in all Good deal for the price!	6

B0093YV4R2-0022
This was our first flat screen Tv purchase.	5
We are very pleased.	5
The picture is great	4
and it has all the features and inputs	5
we need.	5
Only negative is the sound.	8
Has the tinny sound of small speakers.	8
Plan to get a sound bar	5
to remedy the situation.	5
Looking to buy another	5
if the price is right.	5

B0093YV4R2-0029
I was searching for an easy to use HDTV for my 90 year-old grandmother	5
and I am happy	5
I went with this RCA 42-inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV.	5
Setup was very easy and the remote is simple to use.	3
Does come with two HDMI, PC, USB port and AV inputs for individuals	1
who wish to connect more components and devices.	1
Displays beautiful vivid colors	4
that are crisp and vibrant.	4
Sound quality is produced from two 8 watt speakers that sound clear and not muffled.	8
Ultra thin and weighs less than 40 pounds.	7
The swivel stand is an added bonus	5
since must table	5
top stands do not move.	5
Great value for the money and highly recommend it.	6

B0093YV4R2-0034
Easy to set up, nice slim lines, great picture and sound.	8 4 7 3
I have a 47 inch vizio	4
and the picture is as good if not better than that tv.	4
It is everything	5
I could have asked for.	5

B009SJNTIY-0004
After having this TV for just over a year,	5
white spots are	4
starting to show up all over the TV.	4
For that much money it's ridiculous	6
that the TV is already going bad.	6
Trying to see	5
if this TV was part of a recall,	5
but since we've had it 14 months - seems	5
like we are out our money.	5
Don't waste your money.	6

B009SJNTIY-0015
I've had this one	5
replaced already	5
once because it starts to get spots after about 6 months.	4
The replacement TV did the exact same thing.	4
Now that I'm beyond warranty I'm stuck with it	5
as the spots get bigger and bigger every day.	4
I used to love the TV,	5
now it just reminds me	5
when I look at it	5
how much I got ripped off.	6
Check any display units in the store,	5
they might have the problem.	5
It only shows	4
when the TV projects white colors.	4
A hockey game is the most obvious way	5
to show them.	5

B009SJNTIY-0021
The TV quality is pretty solid for the price	6
but within 2 months one of the lcd back lights failed.	4
I called Vizio	2
who said	2
they would send out a " TV	2
we can't call new " to me as a replacement.	2
This means I spent full price on a used TV.	2 6
Shipping was supposed to come a week later	2
but they canceled.	2
They rescheduled another week and by that time the entire TV went black.	2 4
So for a week I now have to sit with no TV	2
that I paid $ 1500 waiting for them	2 6
to bring my used TV	2 6
that I still paid $ 1500 for.	2 6
Apparently the backlight going out is a pretty common problem.	4
Easy to find on the internet.	5
In hindsight... size isn't everything.	7
I should have purchased a better brand.	5

B009SJNTIY-0025
Very poor picture.	4
I bought this at costco for $ 1450.	6
At home I did a side to side comparison to my 55 " full array Sony.	5
The vizio picture was quite poor in comparison.	4
Very grainy and lousy motion control.	4
I think	5
I will wait for the Vizio P series	5
and see how that looks.	5

B009SJNTIY-0027
Picture quality is OK but not fantastic.	4
My 5 year old Panasonic 50 inch plasma has a better picture	4
but this is not bad.	4
What is disappointing is the viewing angle.	4
If you are not looking straight on at the TV,	4
it appears washed out.	4
Perhaps I just need to tune it better	5
but I think	5
my other Vizio LEDs have a better picture overall.	4
You will also need a good source of video	5
as because it is a 70 inch,	5
any imperfections are seen easily.	5
Even while watching basketball games,	5
you can see	5
when different cameras are used.	5
The White Glove service was not there either.	2
Pilot delivered it	2
and only came with one person	2
despite the fact	2
that the box clearly says	2
that it requires two people.	2
My 100lb wife had to help him carry it downstairs.	2
This is still a good value for the money	6
but had expected better.	5

I will start off	5
by saying	5
this tv completely fails as a smart tv.	0
It comes preloaded with netflix	0
which would be great except for it lacks the processor speed necessary to actually stream anything.	0
Lacks a net browser and the only thing	0
that I hsve found to work well	0
is pandora.	0
Fortunately this is not	5
why I bought the tv.	5
I got it because of the picture size and price.	4 6
The picture is a good quality	4
and has very little lag watching sports.	4

B009SJNTIY-0042
Wonderful television picture, size and quality are all excellent.	4 7
The price was excellent	6
and I highly recommend this television to anyone	5
who is looking for a big screen smart tv for a good price.	7 6
The only reason	5
I couldn't rate it	5
a full 5 stars is	5
because the sound quality is good but not great i.e.	8
the bass is marginal at best.	8

B009SJNTIY-0046
Good quality and picture but the sports programs	4
I have watched get a little choppy.	4
All in all I am quite happy for the price.	6
It's funny	5
how a massive 70 " tv seemed giant	7
when I got it.	7
Now it seems like a normal size	7
and I want an 85 "!	7

B009SJNTIY-0075
I absolutely love this TV.	5
Excellent picture quality and sound.	8 4
The best feature is the ease of the applications.	0 3
The user interface is very user friendly	0 3
and everything is easily accessible.	0 3
The remote makes	3
using this TV very easy.	3
We also purchased a high end 70 " Sony the same day we purchased this TV.	5
The Vizio was by far a better TV.	5
I wish	5
we had purchased 2.	5
Delivery was excellent and easy.	2
The delivery people checked the TV	2
before leaving.	2
This is my favorite TV ever.	5

B009SJNTIY-0083
Can't go wrong for a 70 inch led tv for less than $ 1600.	7 6
The quality of the picture is amazing	4
after applying some calibration settings.	4
Colors really pop	4
and blacks are decent for an edge lit led.	4
Don't really notice any motion blur even with soap opera effect	4
turned off.	4
I sit about 9 feet away	5
and it's perfect.	5
Not to big not to small.	7
Delivery guys did	2
an awesome job bring it in the family room	2
and putting it on the stand.	2
I highly recommend this tv to anyone	5
looking for quality at a great price.	6

I bought the TV at Fry's after salesperson assured	5
me headphones would work with this TV	5
however after buying two different sets of headphones,	5
I realized its not the headphones but the audio outputs on the TV	1
that are not functioning.	1
Got online for website	2
shown on owners manual	5
shown tclusa.com	2
and it has apparently been shut down	2
(only has ads for amazon TVs	5
and not support or contact numbers).	2
I would not recommend this company	2
because they have no reliable support system in the US.	2
Frustrating!	5

B00BP5N498-0003
When I bought this TV,	5
I was looking for a solid 58 ' 120HZ TV	5
without 3D or smart capabilities.	5
I read the reviews	5
and I thought	5
this would be the perfect fit.	5
I was so wrong.	5
Spend the extra couple hundred	5
and buy a TV from a well respected company.	5
Below is the list of my Buyer Beware remarks :	5
The picture quality was worse than my 5 year old LCD Samsung.	4
The TV is not true 120hz.	4
It is the 60hz awkward enhanced magic.	4
Fast moving objects were incredibly pixelated and blotchy.	4
It was very disappointing.	5
The TV died exactly 2 months after purchase.	5
The TV would power on to a black screen.	5
Sending it back to Amazon incurred a 20 % restocking fee.	2
After returning this TV to amazon,	5
I went	5
and bought a LG TV.	5
I could not be happier with the new TV	5
and wish	5
I would not have been such a cheap skate a few months ago.	5

B00BP5N498-0013
I own the last model.	5
Within a year the HDMI ports stopped working	1
and the TV would go black for about three to five seconds every few minutes.	4
It provided a stable but lower quality resolution picture with the composite cables.	4
Other people have also reported the problem.	5
TCL phone reps refused to let me bring it to a service center	2
located in a city 40 miles from my house	5
(I planned to drive)	5
and insisted	2
I mail it to them	2
and pay an additional $ 50 shipping charge.	2
I decided not to bother fixing it	5
since it is just a cheapo kitchen TV.	5
The sound quality is okay for the price.	8
Never did find a code	5
which worked the TV through my Comcast remote.	5

B00BP5N498-0014
It was great for the first 6 months then all of a sudden it wont turn on,	5
Ive tried different outlets and nothing.	5
Customer service is non	2
existent I was on hold over an hour	2
and finally hung up,	2
TWICE!!	2
Ive tried them on line	2
and the page gets an error message every time.	2
It looks good for the price but its really not worth it.	6
SKIP THIS TRASH!!	5

B00BP5N498-0017
I bought this in a rush	5
because my previous TV	5
(a Samsung 42 " plasma) had	5
gone out	5
and I wanted to get a replacement very quickly.	5
In retrospect, I wish	5
I'd given myself more time and not bought the first thing	5
that jumped out at me.	5
It's not that it's a bad TV,	5
it's just not great either.	5
It feels smaller than 40 "	7
when I 'm	5
watching it,	5
the picture is decent but not quite as nice as the Samsung	4
it replaced.	4
It has all of the inputs	1
I hoped for	1
(3 HDMI	1
being important to me).	5
But at the end of the day, it's just an okay tv in my opinion.	5
For the price, it was a pretty solid option.	6
That said,	5
a big part of me wishes	5
I 'd	5
spent a bit more	5
and gotten something better.	5

B00BP5N498-0021
The TCL TV is an odd mix.	5
The sound is	8
surprisingly very good and for general TV viewing	8
does not need a sound bar.	8
The sound is better	8
than TV's twice its price.	8
The picture however was very disappointing.	4
I struggled	5
for 4 days	5
trying to get this TV	5
is look good.	5
I found	5
that it was inconsistent. 720p cable TV looked	4
washed out but 720p movies	4
that I had ripped looked okay.	4
Blacks were okay,	4
but bright colors generally looked	4
posterized and the " blocks " during up conversion were pretty obvious.	4
Funnily enough the 120hz was great watching a BPL football game.	4
My conclusion after fighting settings was that the TV would be great for sports games and watching my own movies	5
(I can control frame rate etc),	5
but for cable TV not so good.	5
Another issue	5
I had	5
was a loose frame around the LED	5
which led to the light	5
bled around the right edge.	5
I sent the TV back.	5
Great value for $ 499 but not for me.	6

B00BP5N498-0033
So far so good.	5
Great picture quality and sound.	8 4
I was a bit nervous	5
about purchasing a brand I am unfamiliar with	5
but if works like a tv should.	5
It took effort	3
to get it connected to verizon	3
and I still have to use the tv	3
remote to turn the tv on and off	3
which is why I gave it 4 stars.	5
Its also way bigger than anticipated but that was me not getting how big a 40 in tv actually is.	7

B00BP5N498-0044
I purchased the 46-inch 60Hz version of this LED several months ago for our bedroom	5
and we loved it...	5
especially for the price.	6
Well,	5
it was time for the living room	5
to get an upgrade	5
and I went directly for the largest TCL LED I could get	5
and this one is it.	5
So far, it's a terrific TV.	5
Good picture,	4
although we don't have anything	5
that can make use of the 120Hz refresh as TV and other media	5
go through a Microsoft Windows Media Center HTPC.	5
It's an absolute `` no-frills '' TV.	5
No `` smart '' capabilities at all and I didn't want them	0
as I have no use for them.	5
Our HTPC, Roku, XBox, and Wii provide all of that for us, and more.	5
If you don't need all the features,	0
but want the size,	7
this TV is a great deal.	5
Keep an eye on the price though... it fluctuates A LOT.	6
You can get it at a really good price	6
if you're patient	5
or aren't in a hurry.	5

B00BP5N498-0056
Great for the price.	6
I just need it for my bedroom,	5
so basic TV work fine.	5
Picture is acceptable and sound	8 4
is above average.	8
I use it for Chromecast,	5
outcome is great.	5
If you budget is under $ 300 for 40 ' TV, then this probably you best choice.	6
I owned a Samsung TV.	5
It is definitely better than TCL,	5
but it costs much more.	5
Again,	5
If you are looking for a basic TV	5
(not smart TV),	5
I recommend it.	5

B00BP5N498-0062
Love this TV!	5
No major issues at all.	5
Video is great,	4
sound is great.	8
For the video, I had to use one of the settings.	4
I saw	5
people take off a star or two for for that fact.	5
Who takes off a star	5
because the default settings aren't to their personal preference?	5
The only issue I encounter is an odd one.	5
Sometimes, after changing TV inputs, the screen goes black after a minute or so.	4
I press the input button again,	4
screen goes back to normal.	4
Not a huge deal.	5
Other than that, I strongly recommend this product.	5
The stand	5
it comes with is pretty flimsy, but as long	5
as it is on a proper TV stand,	5
it's no issue.	5
