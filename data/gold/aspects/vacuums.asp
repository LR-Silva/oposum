B00008V40C-0014
Like other reviewers	5
have said, the Dirt Devil Power Stick is a waste of money.	5
It is incredibly noisy,	4
but has little to show for all of the commotion.	5
It has below average perfomance on tile or wood floors	7
and is totally useless on carpet.	7
I threw mine out after just a year ;	5
by the end of the year, I could hardly stand to use it anymore.	5

B00008V40C-0022
I have never hated a product more than this one.	5
It is so loud	4
that it hurts your ears.	4
The dirt is just blown around	7
and you spend all of your time revacuuming spots.	7
I am getting rid of it.	5
Don't waste your money!!!	5

B00008V40C-0032
I just bought this	5
and used it two times.	5
Like others said,	5
its very powerful.	7
But the power works against it.	7
First of all,	5
when I started it up,	3
it jumped out of my hands.	3
The noise is deafening... seriously.	4
It is much, much louder than my very powerful full upright.	4
My ears actually were ringing	4
when I was done.	4
It also was frustrating	5
because the `` exhaust '' comes out at an angle	7
that blows around the very dirt you are about to vacuum.	7
The smaller amped Dirt Devil stick vac works much better.	5
I plan to return it for the smaller one.	5

B00008V40C-0040
This stick vac is powerful alright.	7
The problem is	5
that the opening on the bottom of the unit is too small.	5
Forget about corners,	5
unless you are positioned right over	5
what you intend to vacuum	5
it won't get sucked up.	7
It is way too loud and blows all of the dog hair and dirt all over the floor.	4 7
I am returning it an	5
getting something else!	5

B00008V40C-0048
This vacuum works,	5
but its the LOUDEST VACUUM EVER.	4
Doggies hide, people flee,	4
and your ears will ring.	4
I have owned many vacuums and shop-vacs,	5
and the Dirt Devil Powerstick is the loudest of all.	4
I recommend earplugs with every purchase.	4

B00008V40C-0053
The Power Stick has great suction	7
but the opening is only about 3 inches wide	5
so it takes longer to clean a room then	5
it would with some other products.	5
It does a good job though with cat hair and bits of kitty litter.	5
The noise	4
that others complain about	4
doesn't bother me but my cat runs and hides	4
whenever I turn it on.	5
It's very lightweight	8
but I wish	0
the handle was a little longer.	0
I find myself stooping a bit	3
when I use	5
it and I'm only 5 ' 4 ''.	5

B00008V40C-0056
I concur with all of the reviews	5
ranging from 1-5 stars on this vacuum.	5
It is loud	4
and the exhaust does blow very strong.	5
These `` cons '' are attributed to the high power	7
that this unit has.	5
It picks up dirt	7
and long hair very well.	7
And	5
since the vacuum head doesn't have a conventional brushroll,	0
it can not jam with hair.	0
This vacuum is used in an apartment with approximatly 800 sq. ft. with 50/50 carpet and tile floor.	5
It loses one star for the noise	4
... although loud,	4
it is bearable.	4

B00008V40C-0067
I love this vacuum for quick clean ups,	5
of which I have many.	5
I have two dogs and a cat	5
so there's always hair and litter somewhere.. this is a quick alternative	5
to pulling out the big vacuum.	5
It's very light weight,	8
works well	5
and has a nice long cord.	3
The only downside is	5
that unlike the big vacuum, there's no skinny attachment to get into the corners.. but it's a small downside,	0
I just gab the dust buster or broom to compensate.	5
I am able to vacuum more often	5
(my `` big '' vacuum	5
is really big and powerful	5
and heavy..)	5
and more quickly, so all in all	5
it helps trendmously.	5

B00008V40C-0079
For such a small machine it really does have great power.	7
I have four small children.	5
I need to sweep after every meal.	5
This is a lot quicker than sweeping.	5
It's great to suck up cereal, crumbs, hair, etc..	5
Keep in mind it does not have any extra tools or a rotating brush.	0
It mainly has suction power.	7
I love it!	5

B00008V40C-0081
It works.	5
Strong power for a small device.	7
I bought it for my laminate floors	5
because I researched	5
that you should not use a vacuum with a beater bar on these floors.	5
I just installed the floors	5
and wanted to protect them.	5
As far as loud, yeah it's pretty loud, but nothing unbearable.	4
I think	5
some people can be just too sensitive.	5
Probably not louder than a regular vacuum.	4
But I bought it for the power.	7
I want it to work and not be weak.	7
So far, it delivers.	7
Great for the price.	6

B0001WW2F8-0005
I bought this vacumn	5
because I have dogs	5
and I read	5
that it sucks very well and for simpicity of use.	3 7
It features a zero on this front.	5
Its noisy and the filter blocks up	4 0
after one use	5
so you have to clean out the whole system	0
and replacing the filters is more expensive than having bagged vacumn.	0
Its heavy and cumbersome	8
and does not last long belt wise.	1
I have to replace the belt every two months or so.	1
All in all not a very low maintenance vacumn.	5
if you just have light vacumning	5
and not dogs that	5
require daily vacumning of the house then its ok.	5
But one could do better	5
i think.	5
I would not purchase one like this again	5

B0001WW2F8-0009
I have had this vacuum for approximately 4 months	5
and it has been nothing but trouble.	5
It does have excellent suction however,	7
I spend more time replacing the belt	1
or taking the entire thing apart to dislodge a clog in the tubes	1
that consists of nothing larger than lint and hair.	5
When the tubes get clogged	5
(which is very often)	5
the only way	5
you can tell	5
is	5
that instead of sucking the dirt into the canister it blows it all over the room.	5
This is the worst experience with an appliance	5
I have ever had.	5
I will NEVER buy another Bissell.	5

B0001WW2F8-0015
I have been using this vacuum cleaner for about a year now	5
and I feel	5
it is not a good one	5
(even though I like the bagless feaure, light in weight and an OK price)	6 8
here	5
is why :	5
(1)	5
The suction is WEAK,	7
many reviewers think the opposite	5
and I believe	5
they were mislead by the effect of the powerful brush!	5
The brush scrapped materials from the surface of the carpet	0
and gives false impression	5
that lots of dirt is collected.	5
(2)	5
It picks up dog hair and dust ok, but not even a small object on the floor	7
(especially bear floor	7
without carpet).	7
(3)	5
The brush keeps rolling at high speed	5
even when the vacuum is in up-right position.	5
I think	5
this is really a poor design.	5
(4) Very noisy, it is louder than the one	4
I had before	4
(which was truly a powerful one).	5
If you are looking for serious vac,	5
I do not recommend this one.	5

B0001WW2F8-0017
Well I have had this vaccum for just over a month	1
and it has died on me.	1
I was using it	5
and the brush on the inside stopped spinning	1
(the clear front allows you to see the brush	5
moving	5
while it is vaccuming,	5
to see the dirt	5
I suppose)	5
and an awful burning rubber smelled came from it.	5
I checked all over for clogs or something	5
wrapped around the inside	5
but found nothing.	5
Also it is very loud	4
compared to my old vaccum.	5
Until now the noise was my only complaint.	4
I need to get another one	5
and it won't be a bissell.	5

B0001WW2F8-0024
I purchased this vacuum in May 2005	5
(my first Bissell).	5
I have had continuous problems with the belt	1
breaking or burning.	1
I am on my fifth belt now,	1
which is about one per month.	1
I have never had problems like this before, not even with my old Eureka	5
that I gave away	5
when I got this one	5
(I didn't go through five belts in 6 six years with the Eureka).	5
Otherwise, it seems to work okay, except the Turbo Brush,	0
which is basically useless,	0
and keep your eye on they many filters	0
that need to be cleaned regularly to keep it working well.	0

B0001WW2F8-0025
I should start by saying	5
that my last	5
(and only)	5
vacuum	5
before this was a canister.	5
Maybe I shouldn't expect this to perform as well on hard floor, I don't know.	5
This cleaned the carpet really well and	7
-- like the other reviewers said	5
--	5
pulled up a shocking amount of crud and dust.	7
The hardwood was another matter, though.	5
It seemed to do an almost adequate job on small crummy stuff,	7
but would not pick up anything rice krispy size ir bigger.	7
As a mother of 4 small kids, I need a vacuum	5
that will pick cereal bits and other food crumbs.	5
This also performed better on the tile and vinyl floors that on the hardwood.	7
I would not recommend this	5
if your house	5
(like mine)	5
is mostly hardwood.	5
If you have wall-to-wall carpet in most of the house, though,	5
this would be a good choice.	5

B0001WW2F8-0028
I absolutely LOVE this vaccuum!	5
This is my third new vaccuum in six months.	5
The others couldn't handle the pet hair like this one.	7
(Two big dogs and a cat!)	5
We have lots of pet hair,	5
and this vaccuum gets up every last bit of dirt and hair.	7
I love the cleaning sensor.	0
It turns green	0
when the floor is completely clean.	0
No more bags!!!	0
It's super easy to empty the dirt	0 3
and clean the filters.	0 3
There are three filters instead of the typical two,	0
allowing the hepa filter	0
to last a longer period of time	0
before replacement is needed -	0
another plus!	0
The turbo brush is my favorite part of this vaccuum.	0
The turbo brush has a self spinner,	0
making vaccuuming the couches and drapes a breeze.	5
The only down side to this vaccuum is	5
that the turbo brush clogs easily,	0
and you have to take the brush apart	0
to remove any pet hair	5
that clogs it.	5
This is the best vaccuum	5
I have ever owned.	5
After two previous bad experiences with vaccuums, this one is a keeper.	5

B0001WW2F8-0045
Good vacuum.	5
Easy assembly with just one screw.	3
Not as noisy as the Hoover monster it replaced, good tools	4 0
that really work on upolstry.	0
Real long cord gets around the house.	3
It's fun	5
to watch the little red	5
a green light tell you	0
when the floor is clean.	0
Filters?	0
I guess	0
we got	0
ta have them now,	0
but they do need attention.	0
This was definitely a good purchase so far...	5

B0001WW2F8-0049
This is a very good vacuume,	5
it has the best suction of any upright	7
I've ever used,	7
I like the fact its bagless,	0
and I can empty the cup after each use,	0
it goes from carpet to ceramic tile	5
and does a super job on each!	5
you can't go wrong bying this vacuume cleaner!	5
and the price is right	6
also!!	5

B0001WW2F8-0073
I love this vacuum.	5
It's not too noisy	4
and it does a great job.	7
The dirt sensor works so well.	0
Usually, I just vacuum along,	5
making sure to get the visible dirt.	5
With the dirt sensor, I know	0
I'm getting the carpet clean.	0
I couldn't believe	5
how much dirt I got out of the carpets the first time	5
I used it!	5
I also like how well it fluffs up the pile of the carpet.	5

B0009RF824-0001
Don't waste your money!	5
The only good suction	7
that the vac has	5
is thru the hose.	7
The hose and the power cord is very short!	3
I have all tile with a few rugs	5
and it doesn't vacuum anything up on both the tile and the rugs.	7
I have to keep going over the same spot over and over again just to get a couple of crumbs vacuumed.	7

B0009RF824-0007
This little vacuum would be great	5
if it ACTUALLY vacuumed up anything.	7
Does a poor job on my wood floors, my old fashioned broom does a better job.	7
As for carpeting, doesn't pick up anything.	7
And pet hair?	7
Forget it.	5
A big waste of money.	5
I'd rate	5
it zero stars	5
if I could,	5
I 'm	5
tossing it.	5

B0009RF824-0012
Purchased this vac. to perform quick clean up jobs	5
and was quite impressed with it	5
when I saw it in the store	5
as it is quite light and compact.	8
It has a major problem however	5
and that is	5
that it won't pick up anything on a carpet surface.	7
It dosen't produce much suction	7
which is probably the fault of an undersized motor.	7
It works a little better on hard surfaced floors but the design of the air discharge directly in the front the unit blows the dust away from the front of the cleaner head	5
making it a challange	5
to catch up with the dust bunnies.	5
I wouldn't waste the money on this cleaner	5
unless you enjoy going through the motions just for the arm exercise.	5
I gave the unit two stars	5
only because it has a nice automatic cord retractor.	3
Too bad	5
that they couldn't have provided a vacume cleaner	5
to go along with it.	5

B0009RF824-0013
I had this vacuum for 2 years	5
and it still works,	5
but I can't use it.	5
The handle was always a weak point and it eventually broke -	1
so I have been	5
using it duct	5
taped together,	5
which was ok	5
until the area	1
where the bottom connects to the body also broke,	1
rendering it useless.	1
I am going to have to add it to a landfill	5
and buy a new one.	5
I am disappointed	5
since it was nice and light - good for carrying up to our loft and small enough	8
to fit in the closet and powerful enough	7
to clean up cat hair.	7

B0009RF824-0015
It won't pick up any lint on my area rug,	7
but it does a great job on the bare floors.	7
I need one	5
that does both carpet and floors	5
(I don't have enough storage for both),	5
so I'm taking this one back.	5
I don't know	5
why this is tagged as cordless,	5
it has a cord.	5

B0009RF824-0018
This is the second Shark stick vac	5
I have owned.	5
My first one worked great for about 5 years.	5
Towards the end of its run it wouldn't suck very well	5
and was consistently getting clogged.	5
In the end the motor burned out.	5
This vac is great for tile and hardwood floors	5
so we purchased another one.	5
Well it seem to be that	5
after only using this product for over a month, Im	1
having the same issues with it already.	1
I guess	5
when you purchase	5
this stick vac	5
you are	5
taking your chances.	5
Good Luck!!	5

B0009RF824-0019
I bought this to clean my laminate wood floors.	5
I wanted something	5
that wouldn't kill my back,	5
was light weight,	8
and didn't tear up my floor.	5
This fits the bill.	5
It is not as powerful as my upright Hoover	7
but it's more convenient.	3
The cord retracts	3
which is nice.	3
It has onboard tools	0
and in a flash I can get into the corners and baseboards with the hose.	0 3
It picks up pretty good	7
but lint gets stuck on the little bottom wheels.	5
Also, it is ESSENTIAL the filter be cleaned often otherwise it doesn't pick up well.	0 7
The filter is easy to clean ;	0
I just take it out back	5
and hose it off.	5
I paid $ 50 for it	6
and think	6
it's worth	6
it.	6
Just be sure	5
and clean the filter	0
and don't expect a regular vaccum in this little guy.	5

B0009RF824-0021
My wife finds her new Shark Vacuum better	5
then the first one we purchased.	5
It is quite,	4
and seems to vacuum better then the first one.	7
Also the retractable cord is a plus.	3
For the price we think	6
this was a great buy.	6
Also the shipping time was great,	5
we received the product a couple of days early.	5
Have a great week.	5

B0009RF824-0024
if you know	5
what your doing,	5
this vacuum is awesome!	5
I need a small light weight vacuum for my hardwood floors.	8
I am handycaped,	5
and need something light and easy to maneuver,	8 3
the retractable cord makes it so much easier,	3
and emptying it is a snap.	3
It is so lightweight	8
that I can even carry it myself.	8
I bought it to put in my RV	5
because it is easy to store in a small place	5
and the handle even breaks down.	5
The suction is very good.	7
I could not imagine anything	5
working better.	5

B0009RF824-0027
Finally, somebody out there got it right.	5
A small, light-weight appliance that can do a big job.	8
I was getting tired of lugging heavy, cumbersome vacuums up and down the stairs	5
and thought	5
I'd look for a more practical alternative.	5
I found one in the Shark.	5
I recommend it highly.	5
From carpet to floor, it does an excellent job.	5
Clean the filter regularly and it this little vacuum won't let you down.	0

B0009WRKSO-0059
I am finally giving in	5
and buying a new one	5
and will be happy to trash this one!	5
From the beginning it would clog up on a regular basis	5
and I would have to disassemble the whole thing to find the clog.	3
I can NOT get it to pick up at all on low carpets,	7
it just spits out the dirt.	5
It will not pick up anything	7
using just the hose.	7
THe latch	0
that holds it upright	5
doesn't work,	5
the pet hair attachment never really worked.	0
It isn't the color of a lemon for nothing!	5

B0009WRKSO-0072
I recently bought an Altima Model 2981BVZ.	5
This vacuum is the most flawed piece of machinery	5
I have ever had the misfortune	5
of using.	5
Every 3 minutes I have to clean the foam filter.	0
I clean more out of the foam filter	5
than I do out of the dust cup.	5
The hose attachments have very little power.	0 7
I am sadly disappointed in the quality.	1

B0009WRKSO-0101
The vacuum has good suction	7
and the brush attachment works great.	0
The filter cover barley hangs on	0 1
and	5
if you bump it,	0 1
it falls off easily.	0 1
When the canister is about half full dirt starts	0
to build up in the path from the filter	0
and the filter gets giant wads of dirt on it also.	0
The spin duster does not really spin that great,	5
nor does it pick up much dust.	5
Overall I was	5
disappointed by this product	5
and will more than likely be returning it to the store	5
i bought it from	5

B0009WRKSO-0104
Too bulky, cord is unusually stiff and tangles are impossible to remove.	3
Mine picks up animal hair	7
but it does spit out a lot of dirt.	7
The attachments are not useful.	0
You do have to clean out filters often,	0
but they're filters,	0
you should want them clean.	0
Would I buy another like it,	5
heck no!	5
Eureka s are not what they used to be.	5

B0009WRKSO-0108
I wanted a new vaccuum	5
because my old one was heavy	5
and had a short on board hose.	5
Well guess what, now I have another heavy vaccuum with a short hose.	8 3
I read negative reviews about this product	5
before I purchased it	5
but decided to ignore them	5
and purchase it	5
because the features looked impressive.	5
It is a powerful vaccum for the money but the spinning duster only `` spun '' maybe twice	6 0 7
so I just clean it the old fashioned way with the hose.	5
I purchased the only extension hose	0
that Eureka makes	0
and it is so long there is very little suction	0 7
so I just deal with the `` too-short '' hose.	5
I suggest Eureka skip the duster on their next model	5
and go for the longer hose	5
if you want to impress me!!!	5
I did give this product three stars though for cleaning ability.	7

B0009WRKSO-0110
This vacuum picks up very well...	7
until of course the filters get blocked	0
and then you have to wash them out.	0
Oh yes.. and after about 1 year of use the back wheel fell off -	1
haven't been able to find replacement part	5
to keep the wheel on.	5
Gave up and just bought a Dyson Dc-17.	5

B0009WRKSO-0113
For the money, this vacuum is so much more than I expected.	6
It is lightweight	8
and has a lot of suction.	7
The only drawbacks	5
I have	5
are	5
that the accessories won't stay intact.	0
The air filter cover and extend want keep popping off	0
and falling off as well as the duster cap.	0
I have owned a lot of vacuums	5
and by far, this is the best one for the money.	6

B0009WRKSO-0116
I love this vacuum!	5
I have a cat	5
and it gets all the hair.	5
The claw is a great attachment.	0
The only problem is the duster,	0
which doesn't spin	0
and keeps falling off	0
while I'm cleaning.	0
Just put it in a closet	5
and keep cleaning...	5
this is a great buy!	5

B0009WRKSO-0119
This product is excellent	5
and works exactly as it suggests.	5
The edge cleaning is better	5
than I have ever seen.	5
The telescopic duster is wonderful.	0
This product is the best of its kind.	5

B0009WRKSO-0123
I, too, bought the yellow Walmart model 2981BVZ	5
after my 10 year old Hoover Windtunnel died.	5
I must say	5
I am impressed with this vacuum	5
even though it only cost about $ 80,	6
compared with almost $ 300 for my Hoover.	5
It cleans remarkably well, as well	7
as my old Hoover did,	5
it is quieter than my Hoover,	4
the telescoping dust brush DOES work,	0
and it is so convenient	3
to empty the dust cup	3
without having to clean the filter each time.	3
True, it isn't self-propelled,	3
but it is relatively light for its size and fairly easy to push around.	8 3
And the Turbo Paw works absolutely great, especially on stairs.	0
The only minor flaw	5
I experienced is,	5
as others have noted,	5
the extension wand falls off	5
when bumped,	5
but I am working on a fix for this	5
and in the meantime, it doesn't detract from the cleaning power of the vacuum.	7
I love it.	5

B000BXKIE4-0002
The vacuum was used about 20 minutes per week but only lasted about 3 years before electrical connection in the swivel portions of the hose started to fail.	1
(We went through about 4 or 5 bags in the entire life of the vacuum.)	0
Pros : Was fairly quiet, good suction.	4 7
Cons : Very short life due to poor design/constuction of electronics.	1
Summary : Will never buy an Electrolux again.	5

B000BXKIE4-0018
While the suction is very good,	7
the `` power nozzle '' is a piece of junk.	5
We've had two now	1
and they quit working	1
just after the warranty runs out	1
(90 days).	5
A call to Eletrolux customer service will convince you they have no customer service.	2
E-mails get you nowhere.	2
We will never buy another eletrolux product.	5
Made in China says	5
it all!	5

B000BXKIE4-0031
The canister is lightweight, quite powerful and reasonably quiet.	4 8 7
BUT the power nozzle is heavy, noisy and turns in only one direction.	4 0 3
The power nozzle also is self-propelled	3
and takes the person vacuuming on a speed race around the carpet.	3
The floor brush is wide	0
and makes for quick cleaning of wide expanses of floor.	0
BUT, it is so wide	0 3
as to be awkward getting into corners and around furniture.	0 3
The telescoping wand is convenient.	0
Storage of two of the tools on the handle is not ;	3
the tools keep falling off.	5
The power cord is short.	3
The hose is too flexible ;	3
it kinks easily.	3
I would prefer to have the on/off button on the handle of the cleaner not the cannister.	3
I have had this not even a week,	5
and already I am disappointed in both the design and the materials	1
used in construction.	1
Added three days after the intial review :	5
The crevice brush is not long enough	0 3
to reach in many common crevices, such as those in a car or under a refrigerator.	0 3
The prongs of the plug had to be separated a bit so the plug does not fall out of the wall socket.	5

B000BXKIE4-0035
Had this vacuum 2 years.	5
It died	5
while I was vacuuming.	5
Pros : is	5
it is quieter than my old hoover.	4
Cons :	5
the cord is too short	3
and didn't retract well.	5
Bags fill up quickly	0
as they are small and expensive.	6 0
It is hard to control	3
when pulling.	3
The floor attachment is to big.	0
The attachments are easily knocked off the wand.	0
I wouldn't recommend this vacuum.	5

B000BXKIE4-0040
I wanted a strong Vac	5
that is why I choose the canister electrolux.	5
Is very light weight and not very loud.	4 8
It does seem to shut down	5
while using it.	5
The attachments are ok	0
could be better.	0
While moving around the canister gets	3
stuck on the cord.	3
I wish	5
I had tryed it out in a store first even thou	5
it has so so power	7
it won't pick up the carpet pile very well.	7
I had inhouse Vac for years	5
then moved	5
and new house wasn't plumbed for in house	5
and was forced to buy Vac.	5
I will be buying another Vac but upright this time less worries of pulling a canister behind me I still give it a 3 star	5
but will have to give it a 0 for ease of using around house.	3

B000BXKIE4-0041
The vacuum works really well to clean medium to low carpet in my apartment!	7
It is quiet	4
so I can clean at night	4
and not disturb my neighbor up and below my room.	4
The only problem	3
I found so far	5
(using for 2 months)	5
is	3
that it doesn't turn very well.	3
You have to do quite a bit of lifting and repositioning the vaccum	3
to turn the unit.	3

B000BXKIE4-0049
Vacuum is quiet	4
and performs well.	7
Removes dog hair from a rug	5
that 3 other vacs left in place.	5
Easy to carry.	3
My only reservation is an excess of buttons and features - typical of all modern gadgets, not only this vac!	0

B000BXKIE4-0056
I like this electrolux ;	5
it works well	5
and it cleans thoroughly.	7
It is a little tricky	3
learning how to manuver it ;	3
it's not as easy as the old traditional electrolux	3
I've used for years.	5
It takes a little	3
getting used to it ;	3
that's why I didn't give it 5 stars.	5
The handle is a little thick and slightly difficult to use.	3
The machine works very well	5
and the house feels so clean	5
after I use it.	5
Electrolux products are excellent ;	5
I used my last electrolux for over 30 years	5
and it's still running.	5

B000BXKIE4-0062
Awesome vacuum, quiet as a mouse.	4
Does a great job on the carpet	7
and getting under and around things.	5
Replacement bags a little pricey but well worth it.	5
This is a very nice product!	5

B000BXKIE4-0077
Everything written in the reviews	5
is true.	5
I wanted to go back to a canister	5
and was looking around at Sears	5
and saw this model	5
clearanced at $ 231.	6
I was a little nervous	5
buying it	5
because I had done zero research on the product.	5
I've used electrolux in the past	5
and always liked it.	5
I've also used Kirby and Hoover uprights.	5
I am thrilled with the electrolux.	5
It's powerful, lightweight and maneuvers beautifully under beds, around corners and tight spots.	3 8 7
For the price I paid,	6
I am beyond excited.	6

B003CUQJZK-0002
I very much regret buying this vacuum.	5
It looses suction	7
when the vacuum bag is only half full	7
and the bags are not cheap.	6 0
But the worst thing about this vacuum is	3
that it will not roll behind me.	3
It flops onto its side	3
and I have to drag it around.	3
I contacted a Miele dealer	2
who said	5
it was a common problem	2
but they would not help me	2
because I purchased from Amazon.	2
I recently contacted Miele customer service	2
which is absolutely horrible!	2
It took multiple emails	2
before there was a response	5
and once they responded	2
they chose to ignore the issue of the vacuum falling on its side.	2
It took two more emails to get this response " Unfortunately	2
it has	5
been recognized	5
that this can be an issue.	5
There is no fix for this. "	5

B003CUQJZK-0007
I had our first Miele 25 years	5
and had to replace only	5
when the universal bags didn't provide a tight seal	5
and kept coming unattached.	5
I had expected at least as good from this model.	5
It was not to be.	5
I can not even use the power head	0
because no one can get it off or on.	0
The issue has become more of a problem	5
as time goes on.	5
At first it was difficult to remove	0
but now it won't even attach to the wand.	0
The design of this newer version is poor	5
and certainly wasn't trialed	5
before it went into manufacturing.	5
The tools were previously stored inside the canister	0
and were easily accessed.	0
Now they sit on top,	5
are in the way	5
and cheaply made.	1
The support for the wand	0
is now on the opposite end of the carrying	0 3
handle making it impossible to carry unless the wand is carried separately.	3
Difficult when carrying up and down stairs.	3
Yes, it does a good job	7
picking up dog hair	7
but that's the only thing	5
that performs as promised.	5

B003CUQJZK-0009
After using a Kirby vacuum system for several years,	5
we were ready to try something lighter and less complicated.	5
After trying the Miele,	5
I am not satisfied for a few reasons :	5
1	5
The power cord is too short.	3
I even have to replug the vacuum	5
in when I'm half way down the stairs.	5
2	5
When using the vacuum on hard floors,	5
some of the dirt/sand gets pushed to the edge of the wall	5
and this vacuum does not have enough suction	7
to get the dirt	5
that is on the edge or corners of the floors.	5
I have to use a separate attachment,	5
which means vacuuming takes me twice as long!	3
3	5
The bags are small.	0
They fill up quickly,	0
and they are expensive.	6 0
It is quiet and light weight,	4 8
but I feel	5
that it just doesn't cut it	5
when it comes to cleaning.	5
I didn't have any of these issues with my Kirby.	5
I will be returning this item,	5
and looking for a new Kirby.	5

B003CUQJZK-0017
My wife and I	5
(in our 60s)	5
bought this Titan after all the positive reviews.	5
We have found	5
that it is quite heavy	8
to move around and constantly overturns	8 3
because of its balance.	3
It can not remove much from oriental carpets,	7
and the hard floor tool moves animal hair around instead of collecting it.	5
I'm going to sell ours	5
and go back to Kenmore.	5

B003CUQJZK-0022
Bought this product	5
after my Kenmore finally conked out.	5
The suction is good as well as the filtering of the air...	7
but because there are only three wheels,	5
it is constantly falling over.	3
The air exhaust	5
is on the top of the canister and blows up.	5
This is annoying	5
if you stand over the canister.	5
The cord is much shorter	3
than my Kenmore was	5
so you have to constantly replug it in.	3
The ring	5
that holds the tools around the hose	5
gets stuck with the hose	5
when you rotate it.	5
And the rug beater doesn't do shag	0
(of which I have several shag rugs).	5
I've had Electrolux and Kenmore vacuums	5
and would say	5
they were much consumer friendly.	5

B003CUQJZK-0026
After having other vacuum cleaners	5
only last for less than 2 years I am hoping	5
that this will last at least 5.	5
If it does	5
I would give it 4 stars.	5
Positive :	5
It's very light, quiet and easy to move.	4 8 3
Negative : The cable is too short,	3
the electric power head for carpet not very wide and powerful and it tips over easily.	0 3
The utensil tray is so-so.	0
Changing the length of the tube requires some fiddling.	0
At almost $ 600 I would have expected better,	6
especially considering	5
that Miele sells comparable units in Europe for $ 300 -	5
$ 400.	5

B003CUQJZK-0036
I really like the suction of this vacuum.	7
The carpet cleaning tool is hard to push	3
unless you turn the suction back.	5
I would rate it 5 star,	5
but the brush for hardwood floors is a little too big.	0
It is awkward	3
trying to get in close places and corners.	3

B003CUQJZK-0048
So far this Miele Titan Canister is	5
just what I was looking for.	5
I am very excited about the outcome of this new purchase.	5
I read a lot of reviews	5
and chose this product over others.	5
It has really good suction	7
and is quiet.	4
I have wide pine floors with area rugs,	5
and the parquet floor brush and the power brush do a really nice job.	0
In addition, it is light and easy to carry around	8 3
-- and it picks up kitty litter!	5

B003CUQJZK-0062
This vacuum is light, quiet, and powerful.	4 8 7
Blows away all of the Kenmore vacuums	5
we've owned in the past.	5
One slight detractor is	5
that there's no on-board storage for the parquet floor attachment	0
as there is for the other attachments.	0
But I figured out	5
that it can hang on the back next to the power cord on the clip	5
that supposed	5
to hold the power head.	5

B003CUQJZK-0069
This vac may not be for everyone.	5
It has it's shortcomings	5
but I believe	5
that's because we Americans expect a lot of convenience in our products.	5
The bag hold very little,	0
it has 3 wheels	3
and is unsteady,	3
the on-off controls are only on the base,	3
the cord is short, NOW...	3
... the suction settings are very convenient,	5
the various attachments really do their job,	0
it's quiet,	4
and best of all this vac does the job	5
that it was intended to do,	5
it sucks like no other vacuum	7
that I have ever had.	7
Before using it the first time I vacuumed my whole house with my old vac	5
and then proceeded	5
to use the Miele.	5
Wow, I was shocked at how much dirt, dust, animal hair, etc.	7
that it picked up.	7
I love this vacuum	5
and would have no other.	5
I honestly can't say enough good about this vacuum.	5
I'd recommend it over and over again as long as I also shared the shortcomings.	5

B005ZFUKG4-0000
But this broke after only one use.	1
It simply quit working.	1
It seemed great,	5
but while cleaning the house the first time	1
using the vacuum,	1
it burnt out,	1
and we have an average household with some dog hair,	5
that had been cleaned only two weeks prior.	5
Probably just a bad unit, but can not recommend regardless.	5

B005ZFUKG4-0001
I ordered the Hoover handheld canister vacuum	5
because the review on it was good.	5
I paid extra to get it the next day,	2
which it did.	2
When I opened the box of tools several of them were missing.	0
I emailed Amazon	2
but never got a reply	2
regarding what can be done	2
to replace the missing and essential tools.	2
After paying over $ 100	6
to get this vacuum I	6
would expect some sort of reply from someone.	2
I am very disappointed in Amazon and Hoover for their poor quality control.	2
I would have returned the whole thing	5
but the vac works fine, I just had to work with some old parts	5
so it could do	5
what I boulght it for.	5
I guess	5
the word quality and customer service no longer exist.	2 1

B005ZFUKG4-0002
Missing hose extension and smelled of something burning	0 1
when turn on.	1
A Hoover representative told me	2
that the smell was from a lubricate	2
and would dissipate with after time.	2
Still waiting	2

B005ZFUKG4-0004
This vacuum works great	5
but it is so loud I can not even get through vacuuming my tile floors.	4
I even tried putting ear plugs in to vacuum with it,	4
but it still hurts my ears.	4
I am going to have to return it	5
and find something	5
that runs more quietly.	5
Any suggestions out there?	5

B005ZFUKG4-0005
I wont have this vacuum	5
to clean the floor at home	5
it is not enough power,	7
but I bought it for a ceramic floor and it's ok.	7
I will like it better	5
if Hoover make the wireless version. : -)	5
Hoover Handheld Canister Vacuum - SH10010	5

B005ZFUKG4-0006
I love this vacuum -	5
it is light -	8
it is powerful	7
and works wonderfully.	5
Great to get in small corners, counters, furniture.	3
There is one small -	5
could be come major problem.	5
The plastic extensions tend to shatter	0 1
if dropped onto a hard surface.	0 1
One of the extensions barely fits	0
and I am afraid	0
that this could become unusable very soon.	0 1
It is a huge disappoint	5
as I love it otherwise!	5
Otherwise I would give it 5 stars -	5
but I am afraid	5
I may not be able to use it before long.	5

B005ZFUKG4-0007
This is a great vacuum.	5
The suction is superb ;	7
it picks up the dirt in my tile's grout lines	7
that my old Ergorapido used to leave behind.	7
Unfortunately, the HEPA filter is small.	0
It requires lots of emptying, or, potentially, lots of replacing.	0
If I were to discard and replace the filter	0
after it filled up,	0
this would be an expensive system.	0
As it is,	5
I don't have allergies,	5
so I just take the filter to the garbage can outside	0
and shake it out.	0
This has saved me from having to buy new filters every week or so.	5
I realize	5
not everyone can empty dusty filters the way	5
I do,	5
but this has been a money-saver for us.	5
I would recommend this vacuum to anyone,	5
as it is lightweight, easy to store, and performs well.	3 8 7

B005ZFUKG4-0010
I have my own cleaning business	5
and was looking for a vacuum	5
that would do everything	5
but unfortunately I just couldn't find it.	5
So in order to go from hard floors to carpet I had to invest in two different vacs.	5
I love my Shark for Carpet	5
and originally purchased a backpack vacuum	5
which only lasted me two years	5
before the motor went out.	5
I did not want another backpack	5
because it was just too heavy	5
but liked the concept	5
because I don't like canister vacs.	5
Based on reviews I went with this one for $ 75.	6
The suction is amazing	7
and does	5
exactly what I wanted it too.	5
I only have two drawbacks on this vac, one	5
I'm tall	3
and the wand is a bit short for me	3
but there's only a few jobs	5
I have	5
that I need this little beauty	5
for so it's perfect.	5
Brush head is small,	0
my old one doesn't fit on this	0
and was twice as wide.	0
Going to see	5
if they sell additional attachments to suit my needs.	0

B005ZFUKG4-0013
Love this! gave my sister one	5
too her apt is tiny	5
and this is really a mighty mini.	3
A pleasure	5
to throw away the dirt,	5
bags are big and easy to get on amazon.	5
Will never have a bagless vac again.	5
I also have the upright and love that too. worth every penny.	5

B005ZFUKG4-0014
I needed a small vacuum	5
to complete cleaning more efficiently and easily.	5
My old one quit and	5
as I had added a new motor to it last year,	5
I decided to look for a new one.	5
I looked at every small but powerful vacuum	5
I could find in stores and on line.	5
Because I live in a rural area,	5
I could not find the Hoover	5
I selected.	5
I wanted to lift and check the convenience	5
of handling it before purchase	5
but could not at that	5
time so I ordered it from Amazon.	5
I was delighted with the handling of this vacuum,	3
it is so easy to maneuver.	3
I had also wanted to be sure	7
it had good suction and the ability	7
to clean really well	7
and was well satisfied.	7

B007LZ9LV6-0002
My wife purchased this vacuum from Amazon less then two weeks ago	5
and it is already having major problems.	1
The vacuum overheats	1
and shuts itself off after less then 5 minutes.	1
The motor sounds	4
like it is ready to explode.	4
We have checked for any clogs, jams etc..	5
It is just poorly built.	1
If we had not already tossed the box,	5
this would be going back.	5
I expected alot more from Panasonic.	5

B007LZ9LV6-0005
At first it was a great vacuum.	5
Then the motor became unbearably loud.	4
I used it in an enclosed room	4
and my ears started ringing	4
because it was so loud.	4
Eventually I started listening to my iPod	5
whenever I vacuumed.	5
Then the engine completely stopped vacuuming.	1
There is an 800 number	2
I have to call to get them to replace it	2
but I'm afraid	2
they may charge me shipping +	2
I don't have the big giant box anymore.	5
They want you to take it to one of 5 vacuum repairers in NY	2
and I'm not going all the way to Sea Girt Long Island	2
to have them repair it.	2

B007LZ9LV6-0008
We have the older version of this vacuum.	5
It was purchased because of it's light weight and our past history with Panasonic vacuums.	8
The bottom line is not impressed.	5
In not so high pile carpet the beater brush just bogs down makes the unit almost impossible to push forward.	3
Other complaints :	5
the hose is way too short	0
and where the hose attaches pops out unannounced.	0 1
So you are happily sweeping	5
and the dirt is being blown back into the room.	5
I would never buy another Panasonic	5
without a trial period and the ability	5
to return it.	5
Just not up to the standards of the old Panasonic bag sweepers.	5

B007LZ9LV6-0013
It does have plenty of power and suction.	7
It is light weight and easy to maneuver.	8 3
The bad is that	5
if you have the new shag style thick pyle carpet	3
then you will see how hard this vacuum is to use.	3
You have to hold it at a very uncomfortable angle	3
since there is not height adjustment.	3
The height adjustment is the angle	3
you put on he handle.	3
That's just weird for me.	5
So you have to have the right handle angle combination for it to not hang up on the thick carpet.	3
I am in the process	5
of trying to return it to the company	5
I bought it from as his is a lot of money to spend on something	6
that isn't easily usable on my carpet.	6 3

B007LZ9LV6-0014
BEWARE!	5
This is little vacuum works absolutely terrific on low pile carpet and even bare tile floors!	5
However,	5
unlike what it claims to,	5
it will not adjust to different carpet pile heights.	3
It bogs down on higher pile carpet	1 3
and doesn't do a good job.	1 3
It's almost impossible to vacuum it at all.	3
I really didn't discover this	5
until after I had it for more than 30 days	5
or I would have returned it.	5
If the one I have is defective,	5
I'm open to exchanging it for an properly operational one.	5
Hope the seller sees this!	5
I'm very disappointed.	5

B007LZ9LV6-0020
I really like	5
that its smaller than my old Bistle & LOVE	3
that I have no longer need	0 3
to wrap up the cord.	0 3
I bought	5
as I have two cats.	5
I have a wooden trip along the base of my carpet	5
seperating it from the wall,	5
this unit claimed	3
to get down deep in the ridges yet I dont see that happening.	3
I went over an area with this one then with my old one	5
and there was still stuff	5
coming up off carpet.	5
I dont love it as much	5
as I thought but do like the idea of its multiple filters	0
and hope	5
that with more uses it willl keep my floors clean.	5
I will be trying the pet tool attachment soon,	0
that should be alot better than just the hose on regular vacuums.	0

B007LZ9LV6-0044
This is my first bagless vacuum.	5
I bought it	5
after viewing a very helpful video,	5
and thought	5
it would be perfect for a small apartment.	5
It was easy to assemble,	3
and I used it immediately.	3
So far, I like it	5
because I can see how much dust it picks up	7
and it's so easy	3
to empty the canister.	3
Just a minor drawback for me is its weight.	8
It's supposed to be light weight,	8
and I guess	8
that's probably so.	8
For me, however, just a little heavier than I thought.	8
But maneuvering is easy,	3
and as I use it more,	5
I probably won't feel it that heavy.	8

B007LZ9LV6-0048
Out of the box I liked the physical feel of the vacuum,	1
all the components are well built.	1
The filter and dirt compartment is easily detachable	0 3
and cleaned.	0 3
The vacuum	5
itself is compact and easily	5
stored.	5
The electric cord is retractable	0
and is conveniently	3
hidden when not in use.	3
The various attachments are of good quality	0 1
and attach easily to the vacuum.	0 3
The vacuum itself has strong suction power	7
and is able to quickly pick up dirt and other grime off the floor and walls.	7
One thing	5
I dislike about this vacuum	5
is	5
that it emits a strong odor every-time	1
I'm done	1
using it.	1

B007LZ9LV6-0050
This is one of if not my favorite vacuum cleaners!	5
First off considering the size	8
(full size vacuum),	8
this one is lightweight!	8
It's not silent,	4
but compare it with others of this size,	4
and it's much more quiet.	4
And the weight.	8
Very light compared to other others of this size.	8
Cord rolls inside the vacuum	0
so that you don't have to roll it up on the back of the cleaner	0 3
(where the cord falls down, etc.).	3
Personally I like this.	5
Nice and neat.	5
Suction power is excellent!	7
This gets down into the thick plush rugs.	7
Really picks up dirt, grind, hair, etc..	7
Comes with your standard attachments.	0
Nothing special there.	5
Keep in mind it's a `` bagless '' vacuum.	5
So when you empty it,	5
you are	5
gon na want to go outside	3
as when you empty it,	3
most likely it will give off a dust cloud	3
(if you are not very, very careful).	5
Panasonic has a winner here.	5

B007LZ9LV6-0065
Very agile and light to maneuver.	8 3
High powered suction + hepa filter = ultra clean rug.	7
For this price point, great value for quality you get.	6 1
Extremely pleased with Panasonic's vac.	5
Thank you.	5

B00A7D2L84-0003
This is my second Samsung vacuum,	5
The fist one was the Robotic,	5
Cost me $ 599.	5
Let along it didn't do the job,	5
but it broke after 3 months.	5
Samsung refused to repair	5
and turned me around.	5
But let's talk about this one.	5
It has absolutely no suction power.	7
When you use the power brush,	0 7
it's more or less OK,	0 7
but without it there is absolutely NO SUCTION.	0 7
The dust bag and all snappers are so flimsy	0 1
and can be broke so easily.	0 1
The vacuum stop	1
working couple of times due to it	1
was overheated.	1
So I had to wait 15 minutes or so to resume vacuuming.	5
I would not recommend this Vacuum to anyone.	5

B00A7D2L84-0004
The floor accessory fell apart and	0 1
when I tried to reattach it the handle shattered.	0 1
This vacuum is cheaply made,	1
doesn't have strong suction	7
and all accessories are constructed of flimsy plastic.	0 1
Not a quality machine and not worth the price.	6 1
JUNK!!!!	5

B00A7D2L84-0006
Had this vacuum for 2 months and the plastic upper wand broke	1
as I was vacuuming.	5
Spent over an hour on the phone with customer service	2
just to find out	2
that they would have the service department contact me within 3 business days.	2
Very frustrating!!!	5
Vacuum worked fine up until this point.	5
Very disappointed!	5

B00A7D2L84-0007
After a few times of use, the plastic	1
that connects the telescopic wand to the handle	1
cracked	1
and broke.	1
Gluing	5
it failed to hold it	5
and eventually it broke off	1
rendering it totally useless.	1
Samsung is a good company,	5
but clearly they used cheap plastic on this area	1
because a search on Google revealed some others	5
who had the same problem.	5
I have contacted customer care	2
and they have promised	2
to get back to me in 2 business days.	2
Not so sure	5
if they will fix it for free,	5
because someone in Customer Care told me they don't fix it for free	2
if it has a physical damage.	2

B00A7D2L84-0009
Consumer reports gave this a good rating	5
and it does a good job cleaning	5
but there are a couple of things	5
that could have been better.	5
The most annoying problem is	5
that the attachments do not fit on the unit	0
so you can't conveniently switch them.	0
Also,	5
to remove hair and string	3
that gets wrapped around the rollers	3
you have to remove several screws	3
to take off the plate in order	3
to get to the rollers.	3
One other thing	5
that is a nuisance is	5
that there are 2 power buttons, one on the handle and one on the canister,	5
sometimes the one on the handle does not work	5
so I have to use the button on the unit.	5
I have had the vacuum cleaner for only a couple of months	5
so I am hoping	5
that the power button on the canister doesn't start having glitches too.	5

B00A7D2L84-0014
Overall a great product but 2 problems :	5
1. like many other reviews, plastic on the telescopic pole is not strong enough	1
and broke.	1
Still cleaning, but have to always pay attention not to definitely break it.	5
2	5
The most annoying : very noisy after 6 months of use.	4
My kids leave the room	5
when I'm getting close...	5
That wasn't an issue at the beginning,	5
actually it was quiet but now it's very annoying.	4
Samsung is working on it right now, no vaccum cleaner for 2 weeks, still waiting...	2
Will keep	5
you posted	5

B00A7D2L84-0015
It seems	5
like it is getting difficult to find good canister vacuums nowadays.	5
This one is about as good	5
as they come.	5
I agree with others	5
that it should have an indicator	5
showing	5
if you are	5
running the Low, Med, or high speed on the brush.	5
You can normally tell by the sound	5
but it isn't always easy.	5
Love the bagless design and good performance.	5
It is hard to please my wife	5
and this one made her happy,	5
so that is a big plus.	5
0	5

B00A7D2L84-0017
Pros -	5
It's light and easy to handle.	8
Picks up cat hair and kitty litter easily.	7
Cons -	5
Wish the handle would stay upright instead of falling over	3
when I release it.	5
Also, sometimes the kitty litter catches below the canister	5
and falls out	5
when I go to empty it.	5
Neither is a deal breaker for me.	5

I love this vacuum!	5
It's powerful and quiet, stylish and functional.	4 7
I love	0
that it came with a hardwood attachment.	0
The power brush is amazing.	0
I have two cats	5
so it is extremely nice	5
that it filters the dander out of the air	0
while you vacuum.	5
I highly recommend this vacuum over the higher priced versions.	5

Every time	5
when I use this vacuum I love it more and more.	5
I was a little bit in shock	5
when I opened the box	5
and I saw the brush.	5
It had the size more than I had expected.	5
I was concerned	5
that It would be heavy.	8
However, the power of the vacuum and its design take care of it :	7
it pushes the brush itself.	3
It is easy to move because of the adjustable wheels on the side of the brush.	3
It fits under my Quin bed.	5
The sides " wrapped " with protective rubber like rim	1
which prevents wearing and tearing the plastic parts on the brush	1
and bumping and scratching furniture.	1
The suction is excellent and adjustable to my needs.	7

I bought this vacuum cleaner from Best Buy in December	5
after ordering and returning a $ 519 Dyson Animal vacuum cleaner	5
that arrived with a sheared off wheel.	5
(Dyson is made entirely of plastic).	5
This Hoover is great on my wood floors,	5
the hose is easy to whip out and use,	3
and the vacuum is lightweight and maneuvers nicely.	8 3
On the downside,	5
it doesn't suck well on carpets	7
and the brush roll turns itself off after a pass or two on the carpet.	0
These problems i dealt with.	5
However, one day recently the brush roll button wouldn't turn on the brush roll.	0 1
I looked at the Hoover self help videos,	2
but they were useless.	2
I think	1
it is an electrical issue.	1
I've taken the vacuum cleaner apart	5
and there are no obstructions,	5
the belt looks fine, and so on.	5
Technically it is still under warranty	5
but I didn't keep my Best Buy receipt	5
so we registered it late and still haven't gotten a warranty card in the mail.	2
What a waste of $ 200.	6

This vacuum was good for the first few months	5
except that hair never gets in the dust bin	5
but all wraps around the brush	3
and is very difficult to be taking off all the time.	3
NOW only seven months after I bought it the brush doesn't turn anymore so is no longer any good for the carpet.	0 1
I will never buy another Hoover product...	5
EVER!	5
I have not yet tried the company for help so	5
but plan to try soon.	5

I'm very disappointed.	5
This vacuum cleaner seemed so great at first.	5
It's very light and compact.	8
It has good suction	7
for cleaning hard floors,	7
which is mostly	5
what I'm interested in.	5
The way the attachments work is very clever and efficient.	0 3
I also like the way you can easily turn on or off the brush roller	0 3
if you need	5
to clean both hard floors and carpet.	5
All that is great,	5
but after using it only a few times,	1
the brush roller would not turn on anymore.	1
I tried cleaning the brush,	5
which wasn't fouled or dirty	5
because I've hardly	5
used it.	5
Still it will not turn on.	1
I read some of the reviews here on Amazon	5
and I saw	5
that a lot of other people have	5
run into the same problem with the brush roller not turning on	1
and they have not had much luck	5
with fixing it.	5
So you can buy this vacuum	5
if you like the features,	5
but be prepared for the brush roller	1
to stop working after a short period.	1

I was happy with this vacuum for the most part	5
until it quit working.	1
The brush needs to be cleaned out almost every time	3
you use it	3
because all hair gets tangles	3
and stuck to the brush bristles.	3
I have cleaned the filter twice,	0 3
and I empty the canister twice during each use.	0
The vacuum recently overheated and the motor stopped working.	1
After cleaning the filters again	5
and letting the vacuum sit unused for 24 hours,	5
the motor seems to be working.	5
Now the vacuum will no longer sit flat on the floor	1
while in use, it stays tilted	1
and therefore can't vacuum anything off the floor.	1
It says	5
it has a 5 year warranty,	2
but the closest repair shop is a two hour drive away.	2
I haven't been able to vacuum for two weeks,	5
and I'm EXTREMELY frustrated!	5
If I have to spend $ 100 in gas	5
to drive to a repair shop,	5
I suppose	5
I may as well buy a new vacuum.	5
I guess	5
I should've paid for the Dyson.	5
Uggh.	5

B00B7871DS-0047
Cleans great	5
but it's heavy and hard to push, especially on large area rugs	8 3
that have a solid backing.	5
It seems to suck down	3 7
and be difficult to move.	3
We have two small dogs	5
and it does a really good job	7
of picking up the dog hair.	7
We also have hardwoods with area rugs.	5
It cleans	5
both well but is a little more work on the area rugs	3
than I'd like.	3
On the second floor we have wall-to-wall carpet	3
and it is not as difficult to push.	3
All in all its OK.	5
If you don't have any dense area rugs	5
it might be rated higher.	5

I did a lot of research	5
before buying this vacuum.	5
Dyson always has the best review	5
but it's too expensive for me.	5
This one seems to be somewhat light-weight	8
and have powerful suction.	7
However, it's dispointing.	5
The suction is pretty powerful.	7
However, it's very heavy.	8
Way more heavier than I expected.	8
And it's not very steerable.	3
The host is short	0
and takes a lot of strength	0 3
to stratch it.	0 3
The dust bin spins dirt around for my first use.	0 1
However, it can't spin anything after second use.	0 1
I'd suggest spend a little more	5
to get a Dyson.	5

B00B7871DS-0073
Very good vacuum for the price.	6
No need to spend your money on the pricey Dyson.	6
We had a Dyson before,	5
and I feel its very overpriced.	5
The Wind Tunnel does	5
exactly what the Dyson can do.	5
The suction on this vacuum is very strong.	7
I vacuum everyday and so far I think its great.	5
Vacuuming on hard floors works very well too.	3
Its well built,	1
sturdy but easy to manuever.	1 3
Some cons :	5
The cord is very short.	0
Also,	5
emptying the canister requires both hands.	0
Dust will get all over your hands.	5
Switching to use	3
the hose is messy	0 3
as it involves flipping up a flap	3
where the dust goes through,	3
dust falls to floor in that area.	5
I would recommend this.	5
You can get 2 of these for 1 Dyson.	5

B00B7871DS-0118
I have had this vacuum for 3 months now.	5
Overall very pleased!	5
It is light weight and easy to maneuver.	8 3
The transition from carpet to hard wood floors is smooth.	3
I have a 3 bedroom home with a small dog	5
and I vacuum at least once a week.	5
The dirt canister usually has to be emptied one or twice	0
before entire house is done	0
but it is no a problem.	0
The only reason	5
i am not giving 5 stars	5
is due to attachments...	0
to use,	5
the user must disconnect from one source	0
and reconnect into new outlet.	0
It is a extra step but not a deal breaker.	5
It is an exceptional value for the price.	6

B00B7871DS-0167
This vacuum is amazing!	5
Effortless manuevering with the twist of a wrist.	3
The hose/handle attachment is great for getting to hard to reach places.	0
Extremely powerful suction picked up anything in it's way.	7
Emptying the canister is as easy	3
as pressing a button.	3
The filtration system is wonderful,	0
helping with our indoor allergies.	0

B00B7871DS-0203
Excellent vacuum and good price.	6
Has more than sufficient suction.	7
I reused a wide and narrow nossel accessory.	0
It only comes with a single narrow attachment.	0
Only downside, excellent otherwise	5
