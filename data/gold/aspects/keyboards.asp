If you 're	7
thinking of getting a new keyboard,	7
spend a few extra dollars	7
and get one	7
that's actually worth using.	7
The layout is tricky, with the enter key bigger than any other key	4
(does anyone have trouble	7
hitting the enter key?)	7
and the backspace key is a tiny little thing	4
that I can never hit the first time	4
without first hitting the \ a million times.	4
The insert/home/delete / end cluster is squished into the print screen/scroll lock/pause keys,	4
which makes quick navigation difficult	3 4
without looking at the keys.	3
The rest of the keys are functional	7
but feel very flimsy.	3
I haven't had a problem with `` squeaky '' keys,	6
but am very frustrated by the backspace	4
being so small and hard to reach.	4
If you're a fan of shortcut buttons,	2
there are the wake up, sleep, and power buttons, but no others for volume, internet, etc..	2
If you 're	7
looking for a cheap, basic model	8
and don't care about retraining yourself to type then	7
this one's for you.	7
Otherwise, spend a few extra dollars	7
and get a keyboard	7
that doesn't feel	3
like you bought it from the dollar shop.	3 8

B0002SAF64-0002
The keyboard is inexpensive and probably fine	8
unless you are a touch typist.	7
Then it has a few quite annoying quirks, such as backspace key	4
is too small,	4
and the set of Insert/Delete/Home / End/PageUp/PageDown has an extra row of keys on a top.	4
Somehow it gets quite annoying	3
when you type fast and type a lot.	3
So,	7
after using this keyboard for about a week,	7
I'll be returning it back.	7
I'll be getting Dell USB keyboard instead.	7

B0002SAF64-0008
The keys on the one	3
I received do not have a consistent feel across the keyboard.	3
Several don't respond to the same level of pressure as the other keys.	3 0
This makes the keyboard useless for someone	7
who really types fast.	7
This keyboard also mushy, in the sense	3
that your keystrokes decelerate more quickly at the end of the stroke into a mush rather than a solid tap.	3
In contrast, good keyboards for fast typing give increasing resistance up to a point and then less resistance down to solid contact at the bottom.	7
You get a feel	7
for where that resistance breaks	7
(and the letter types),	7
and you can type	7
without hitting the bottom hard on most strokes.	7
On a mushy keyboard like this one, you're never sure	3
if your keystroke has registered,	3
so	7
after typing several sentences	7
missing half the letters,	7
you hit the keys harder to compensate.	7
The spillproof design is interesting though.	2
Not sure	7
why more keyboards don't feature this.	7

B0002SAF64-0009
This keyboard is perfect	7
if you hammer away for hours on end	7
and are looking for something stiff and sturdy	0
that feels like it will last for years.	0
I, on the other hand, find it to be too stiff.	3
It's an plain-looking, solidly-built thing,	5 0
and I will keep it as a back-up,	7
but this won't be a daily-use keyboard for me.	7
It simply requires too much effort	3
to press each key.	3

B0002SAF64-0012
Pros : Not very expensive, supposedly spill proof, good 104 key layout.	8 4
Usable with both USB and PS2 ports.	1
Decent appearance.	5
Cons :	7
Usual mushy feel of a `` chicklet ''	3
(membrane) keyboard.	3
I keep hoping against hope	7
that I'll find a decent office keyboard with a good `` feel ' at a moderate price.	7
This is not that keyboard.	7
I guess	7
I'll have to give up and just resign myself to much more expensive mechanical key units.	7
However, they start at $ 50 or higher, not a trivial additional amount.	7
Top notch units are $ 100 or more.	7
Ouch!	7
But for anyone	7
who uses a keyboard a lot, well worth the money.	7

B0002SAF64-0013
If you do a lot of typing this keyboard's layout	4
can become frustrating.	4
The backspace key is really small,	4
and the insert/delete / home/end	4
/ etc. cluster is one row lower than usual.	4
Also, the spacebar does squeak slightly as the other reviewer mentioned.	6
But	7
if you don't mind the layout	4
and aren't going to be typing 8 hours a day,	7
then you'll probably have no complaints.	7

B0002SAF64-0018
I have had this keyboard for a few years now	7
and it has functioned	7
without a glitch.	7
I type on it hours a day,	3
and the keys never stick or are hard to press.	3
I took a star away, though,	7
because it does make about as much noise	6
as you could imagine	6
a keyboard would make.	6
I've owned keyboards in the past	7
that were whisper quiet	7
which was nice	7
because the rest of the office didn't have to know	7
whether you were typing or not.	7
They will know with this one.	6
But	7
after going through numerous more expensive keyboards,	7
I have been happy as a lark	7
that this very inexpensive one has been going for years	8
without any issues.	7

B0002SAF64-0020
When my computer started randomly ignoring keystrokes on my old OEM multimedia keyboard,	7
I decided to get this Kensington Keyboard for Life	7
to replace it due to it having a number pad but still being a smaller form-factor than the old keyboard,	4
leaving more room on the keyboard tray for mouse and mouse pad.	4
I've been very pleased with the product	7
and it seems to not only work well	7
but " feel " well, too.	3
Good construction,	0
and truly anticipate it having a very long life.	0

B0002SAF64-0027
I just got this keyboard,	7
and I already love it.	7
It has the same	3
satisfying ` clickiness ' of the original IBM PC keyboard.	3
The only negative is the size of the backspace key	4
--	7
it's not oversize	4
as it is on many newer keyboards.	4
But that's not a problem for me,	7
as I am used to a smaller backspace.	7
This keyboard has the ` Wake Up ', ` Sleep ', and ` Power ' keys	2
that most Vista-capable computers support.	2
I particularly like being able to shut the system down with a keypress	2
--	7
I haven't been able to do that since my Mac days back in the late '80s!	7
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this keyboard, particularly for someone	7
who wants the essentials,	7
without all the ` media keys '	7
and other junk	7
that seem to be found on most keyboards today.	7

B0002SAF64-0028
This is a really surprising find!.. a computer keyboard	7
that is not all plastic.. actually	0
has weight to it...	0
does not move around when you type.. and stays cleaner than my last 70. 00 microsoft keyboard.	7
This is a very affordable keyboard	8
that will provide you with many hours of dependability...	7
BUY IT!	7

B0007SXGJW-0000
The thing was for a serial port	1
not a USB port and new computers don't have serial ports.	1
A bust.	7
I have an old computer upstairs	7
which I'll hook it up to so it won't be a total waste.	7

B0007SXGJW-0002
I purchased a Microsoft Wired PS/2 Keyboard from Amazon.com one month ago,	7
to replace two previous keyboards	7
(another brand)	7
which were unsatisfactory due to fading or chipping of the letters from the most frequently used keys.	7
I presumed	7
that a `` name brand ''	7
(Microsoft) keyboard	7
would be of superior quality,	7
giving me longer service.	7
I was wrong.	7
My previous `` generic brand '' keyboards lasted 6 to 8 months each,	7
before certain frequently used	7
letters disappeared from the keys.	7
My Microsoft PS/2 keyboard had been in service just one month,	0
and 5 or 6 frequently used	0
letters are already faded to the extent	0
that they are likely to disappear completely in another month.	0
I am extremely disappointed in the quality of the Microsoft keyboard	0
I recently purchased from Amazon.com.	7

B0007SXGJW-0003
I think	7
it was just the keyboard	7
that I received,	7
but my spacebar would get stuck all the time.	0
If I pressed the spacebar,	0
the computer would register multiple spaces.	0
I am pretty sure this is not a software/driver issue,	7
I even downloaded the microsoft drivers	7
and tried different keyboards,	7
it only happens with this one.	7
And overall, the construction and materials used	0
is much inferior to the logitech	0
that I'm using now.	7
I used to be a fan of microsoft mice in the past	7
and thought	7
I'd give this a try,	7
I don't think	7
I will be buying another Microsoft peripheral again.	7

B0007SXGJW-0004
A cheaply-made, flimsy keyboard.	0
This keyboard -	7
although it is functional -	7
is not worth the fifteen bucks.	8
It's a 7 or 8 dollar keyboard	8
that,	7
because of its branding,	7
is selling for double its worth.	7
Microsoft hardware used to be consistently better than average.	7
Not anymore.	7

B0007SXGJW-0005
Pros :	7
Good typing feel.	3
Nice pre-programmed buttons for volume, calculator, and MyComputer.	2
Cons :	7
Cheap build : the little legs in the back	0
for tilting the keyboard break off right away.	0
The home, end, insert, etc. keys are awkwardly placed.	4
Definitely not worth more than about $ 10!	8
But	7
if you don't tilt your keyboard,	7
you might not think	7
it's bad at all.	7

B0007SXGJW-0009
I have this at work	7
and it's ok, but not great.	7
Either I can't type quietly	6
or it is not a quiet keyboard ;	6
either way, I'm looking for a replacement	7
and hope this issue will disappear.	7
Do not purchase	6
if looking for a quiet keyboard.	6

B0007SXGJW-0013
Unlike many people, I just want a standard keyboard with good touch and a PS2	7
(not USB) plug.	7
Although this model has some custom keys for email, brower activation, music, etc,	2
I didn't bother with them.	7
The keys are a standard layout except for the Home/End cluster	4
which is vertical instead of horizontal.	4
That places the Insert key	4
where the Delete key usually is,	4
but it hasn't been much of a problem.	7
For the price,	8
I think	7
this is a good buy,	8
and much better than other $ 15 keyboards.	8

B0007SXGJW-0018
This keyboard is a very good value.	8
It has only a PS2 connection, so	1
if you need to use USB	1
you will need a converter plug.	1
I needed a PS2,	7
so it was OK for me.	7
Also,	7
I deducted one star	7
because the cord	7
for connecting to the computer is a little shorter than the one	7
I had,	7
but if your computer isn't too far from your keyboard,	7
you'll be ok.	7
Keys are quiet	6
and require minimal pressure.	3
Has a top row of quick link	2
keys including Favorites, Mail, Homepage and Music and others.	2
Nothing fancy,	7
but if you need a simple, quiet keyboard	6
this one will work well for you.	7

B0007SXGJW-0022
I bought this as a simple back up for my wireless keyboard.	7
When the batteries go out I planned to use this one.	7
I ended up	7
using this one nearly exclusively!	7
Yep its cheap and dinky,	8
but it does the job well,	7
feels good, has nice extra features,	3 2
and is CHEAP!	8

B0007SXGJW-0026
I love this keyboard.	7
It's cheap, simple, and smooth.	3 8
My only problem	7
I had with it	7
was getting used to the new positioning of the Home, Insert, Delete, End, Page Up, and Page Down keys	4
since they are at a perpendicular	4
angle that of most other keyboards.	4
It's a great keyboard,	7
but may take some time	7
getting used for certain tasks.	7

B0009VU7RG-0001
I purchased this for a new Mac Mini.	7
I do not like the key action, the key noise and the cheap feel of the keyboard.	3 6 0
I shall return it to Amazon.	7
Pros : works	7
as it should right out of the box.	7
Special feature keys	2
(volume control, mute, disk eject, power-off)	2
are handy.	2
Cons : noisy keys,	6
keyboard feels cheap,	3
key travel is shallow	3
and lacks	3
the quality feel	3
and quiet of every other Mac and Windows keyboard I use at home and work.	6
Verdict : Try any keyboard	7
before you purchase.	7
If you dislike a cheap feel, noisy keys or a shallow mechanical key action,	3 6
you will be dissatisfied with this keyboard.	3 6

B0009VU7RG-0002
What can I say?	7
I love Macally normally,	7
but someone botched the job here.	7
Keyboard arrived with numerous letters popped out of the case.	0
I had to pop them back in.	0
Once I reassembled it,	7
I boxed it back up as a gift.	7
My recipient got it,	7
hooked it up	7
and found the P key to not be working.	0
Ironically, the P key wasn't one of the many keys	0
that had popped off.	0
Additionally, my friend's USB 2. 0 webcam won't work with the keyboard	1
yet works fine in other ports	1
so it's not the webcam	1
he uses	7
that is the problem.	7
I'm very disappointed	7
because the features of this keyboard were just	7
what was wanted.	7
It has 2 USB 2. 0 ports	2
but useless if a 2. 0 device plugs into one?	2
Maybe it's a low-voltage USB hub in there,	7
but if so,	7
packaging should state that clearly somewhere.	7

B0009VU7RG-0003
I can not stand this keyboard.	7
I was forced to use one for a while,	7
and I decided to purchase a standard aluminum Apple keyboard with number pad	7
to save my sanity.	7
This Mac Ally keyboard is very loud and also cumbersome.	6
However, it does hold pencils and pens quite well!	2
I'm confident	7
that	7
if I were to pound on my desk,	7
the pencils would remain in the handy pencil/pen recess.	2
I gave 2 stars	7
because the keyboard does work,	7
it's just not comfortable or quiet.	3 6

B0009VU7RG-0008
I bought three of this keyboards.	7
I like the finger feeling, quiet and soft.	3 6
The biggest problem :	7
it does not last long.	0
After a few months of usage, for example, the cmd + copy starts to work badly.	0
If you want to have a keyboard for a short period of time,	7
this one will serve you well.	7
I myself am	7
looking for a better solution.	7
I may try the latest apple one,	7
and see how it performs.	7

B0009VU7RG-0010
This was the cheapest keyboard	8
I could find,	7
and it does work, its just really loud!	6
It sounds almost	6
like you're typing on a typewriter.	6
I was too lazy to return it.	7

B0009VU7RG-0014
Yes, it looks and feels cheap	3 5 0
and it's noisy to type on,	6
but for $ 20 it gets the job done.	8
Does it bother me as an apple geek?	7
You bet	7
it does!	7
If you just need an extra keyboard	7
go for it.	7
But	7
if style matters then spend the money	5
and get an apple keyboard.	7
Or another one.	7
Whatever.	7
I just didn't need to spend $ 50 -	7
$ 70 on an extra keyboard.	7
Which is what this will be someday.	7

B0009VU7RG-0025
This keyboard is indeed noisy,	6
but you know what?	6
I like that.	6
I also like not having to replace batteries every week.	7
The number pad on the right side of the keyboard is a clutch feature, too.	2
If you are a conventional home-row typer,	7
this keyboard will feel much more natural than the stock Mac keyboard.	3
It is used by the three kids and me,	7
and we all agree	7
that we prefer it,	7
and we rarely agree on anything.	7

B0009VU7RG-0029
This is a very nice keyboard for the price.	8
It is a bit loud,	6
but not the loudest I have heard.	6
The keys have a loose feel,	3
but it has all the buttons to interface with my iMac,	1 2
and has 2 USB 2. 0 ports.	1 2
Power button,	2
and keypad.	7
Beats the new flat iMac keyboard for feel.	3
It can be angled/raised at back,	2
and has volume controls.	2
Not the highest quality keyboard, but good in features,	2 0
large sized keys, easy to type with responsive smooth keys to the touch, with a slight dip in each key.	3
Has a spot for a pen or pencil	2
to lay at top of keyboard.	2
I recommend for those	7
who wish to save money	7
yet need a Mac keyboard!	7

B0009VU7RG-0034
I kept buying original iMac keyboards	7
and they kept breaking on me.	7
This one does not look like the original	5
but has all the keys like the original	4
except for the multimedia keys are not labeled but do work.	2 4
This one feels more like a PC keyboard	3
and it is wider	4
but it does last longer.	0
It is slim but not as slim as the iMac more like a slim PC keyboard.	5
Looks cheap but its not.	5
For the price i would buy this one any day.	8
Does not look as good as the original but last longer	5
and feels good to type in.	3

B0009VU7RG-0035
I must've bought at least five of them over the years.	7
Not that they don't last -	7
they've gone with systems I've either sold or gifted to people.	7
This has a short, laptop-style keystroke,	3
which gives much more positive feedback than the current Apple keyboards.	3
For me, that means fast, accurate typing.	3
The control/option/cmd keys are in the right place, Hooray!	4
Price of entry is way below the current Apple keyboard,	8
and this is orders of magnitude better than the old white Apple Pro keyboards or any of the awful USB keyboards	0
that came before it.	7
Beware that it does have a rather large footprint,	5
although the design is attractive	5
and doesn't look out of place with the other Apple junk on my desk.	5

B001FB55GC-0001
When this keyboard worked,	7
it was everything	7
I had hoped for and more.	7
The keys had the perfect amount of tension,	3
the spacing was impeccable,	3 4
and the wrist rest was comfortable and stylish.	3
Also, the wireless connectivity was good for my small room.	1
But about 6 months in of light use	0
(never left my desk),	0
the S and A keys slowly started to malfunction.	0
For a keyboard this price, it is ridiculous.	8
I've switched back to a cheap $ 10 dell keyboard	7
that can be dropped and stepped on with no ill effects.	7
If you want to repurchase a keyboard every 6 months to a year,	0
then this is the keyboard for you.	7
For everyone else, stay away!	7

B001FB55GC-0005
This keyboard is beautiful and sleek	5
and feels awesome	3
when typing.	3
Unfortunately it has many keys	0
that don't work.	0
Just google it	7
and look on the Logitech forums.	7
You will see that the same keys aren't working for all these people.	0
I bought one	0
and it malfunctioned right out of the box.	0
Returned and got a second one with the same problem.	0
Finally got one	7
that did work.	7
Wold be a great keyboard	7
if it worked.	7

B001FB55GC-0008
I've had this keyboard for over a year with minor use.	7
The only issues	7
I had :	7
1.)	7
The reception was sometimes spotty in registering clicks.	1
The receptor was at ye level in the back of my desktop standing 5 feet away.	7
2.)	7
The spacebar rarely was recognized	3
when typing from the * SIDE * of the spacebar.	3
Tremendous mistake by Logitech designers.	7
3.)	7
After a year of limited use, certain keys on the upper left had corner of the KB	0
just suddenly stopped working.	0
On a positive note, Logitech Customer Service took care of my defective KB under the warranty plan	7
when the keys stopped working.	0

B001FB55GC-0009
Ordered a `` brand new ''	7
(not a refurb)	7
Logitech dinovo keyboard for notebooks.	7
Took a while to ship.	7
When I opened up the Amazon box,	7
the logitech box inside had already been opened...	7
I was thinking maybe it came open while	7
being shipped.	7
Nope.	7
It had small scratches	7
that looked like whom ever opened	7
it had tried	7
to clean it	7
and left little swirly scratches on the piano black portion in between the num pad and keyboard.	7
I still would have looked past all that	7
and been happy to have kept it,	7
but the F, L and q keys don't work at all.	0
I didnt check the num pad or any of the other keys.	7
I finally realized	0
that those keys were dead	0
after trying to troubleshoot it on logitech's site.	7
I am pretty disappointed Cause	7
I really liked the look of it : (	5

B001FB55GC-0013
Logitech makes the best keyboards and mice, hands down.	7
I ordered this in 2009 along with an HP keyboard to compare,	7
but there was no comparison.	7
The Logitech keyboard Had a much better build quality,	0
look and feel,	3 5
and those signature buttery smooth keys.	3
Typing on this keyboard is like velvet or down feathers or something so silky smooth.	3
But, a big but, in the end this keyboard has serious flaws.	7
It lags and is unresponsive at times,	7
it disconnects from the USB dongle	1
and needs to be re-setup,	1
And worst of all the power switch is very flimsy and no longer connects.	0
I have to jiggle and wiggle it into exactly the right position	0
to stay on.	0
Expected more from Logitech's top dollar keyboards.	8
Well, it came out 10 + years ago so not too unexpected.	7
Ive decided to chuck it and go with a much newer, cheaper, lighter version, the K360.	7
Only 24 bills,	7
and connects with my Logitech mouse to the Unifying receiver...	7

B001FB55GC-0014
I really like the diNovo keyboards.	7
They are well contructed	0
and have high-quality scissor keys.	0
The battery life is measured in years.	7
The USB connection is tiny.	1
This keyboard will work with or without the SetPoint software loaded.	1
I didn't bother to configure the function keys	2
so they're pretty much useless.	2
By design, the Eject key is just over the Backspace key	4
and I hit it by accident all of the time.	4
My DVD is open	7
as I write this.	7
You couldn't put the Eject key in a worse place	4
if you tried.	4
What were they thinking?	7
And who needs a dedicated key	7
to eject a DVD?	7
My IBM keyboard worked	7
my email word processor etc. out of the box	7
once I installed the driver.	7
I don't have the time	7
to waste setting up this keyboard's function keys.	2
You would think	7
that Logitech could default the function keys to - call me crazy -	7
Microsoft Office, Windows Media Player, Internet Explorer, etc..	7
No, it's much better	7
to default to nothing	7
and make every end-user setup the function keys manually.	7

B001FB55GC-0025
This has been a great little wireless keyboard.	7
It's small	7
and I keep it on my bedside table	7
to use with my media pc.	7
I've had it for over 6 months	7
and it's still on the first set of batteries.	7
The buttons have great feel like most logitech stuff.	3
The keypad feels like a good laptop keyboard.	3
If it had a touch pad	7
it'd be the bomb.	7
It would also be nice	7
if the keys did illuminate.	2
It does feel like a quality piece in your hands, not some super cheap wireless keyboard.	0
I caught it on sale for around $ 25.	8

B001FB55GC-0027
This keyboard is great.	7
I purchased it on 8/24/09,	7
and have lately began to see intermittent radio problems.	1
PRO's :	7
The combination of black gloss plastic	5
and aluminum give it a very high quality look and feel.	3 5
Its short vertical button travel allows for minimal easy transition from laptop to this keyboard	3
as the two feel very similar.	7
For fifty bucks, its was a great deal.	8
CON's :	7
After 3 years of good use, the keyboard looses connection with the dongle 2-3 times per week.	1 0

B001FB55GC-0040
What can I say, its about time, perfect keyboard.	7
Keys are light and easy to use,	3
layout is perfect,	4
programmable function keys are great.	2
Just wish	7
I wouldn't have waited so long	7
to purchase!	7
If your looking for a wireless keyboard, desktop or laptop,	7
this is your keyboard...	7
you will not be disappointed!!	7

B001FB55GC-0042
I like everything about this keyboard.	7
Most of keyboards today have a lot of useless keys	7
that only occupies	7
the real estate space	7
making space and control keys	7
crammed,	7
but this one is simple and clean.	7
The keyboard looks slim and sexy.	5
I am using it for desktop PC, don't know	7
why they are emphasizing as for notebook though.	7
You won't regret it!	7

B002MUYP3E-0002
I've had this keyboard for about six months	0
and the letters are wearing off of the keys.	0
I've had many keyboards over the years	7
and none have done this even after several years of heavy use.	7
The letters should be molded into the plastic.	0
Instead they 're	0
applied to the key surfaces afterwords.	0
The volume control keys are on the right side,	4
and they 're	7
activated by a function key	4
that is also only on the right side.	4
That means changing	4
the volume	4
(or muting)	7
requires the movement of both hands.	4
It's a poor design for such frequently-used keys.	4
The arrow keys are a bit too small for such often-used keys.	4
I bought the HP wireless keyboard,	7
and it has none of these problems.	7
It is larger however,	7
and it has short-stroke keys like a laptop.	7
Some may prefer the more standard keystroke	7
that the Logitech offers.	7
All-in-all, I like the cheaper HP much better.	7

B002MUYP3E-0003
Cons : Tiny delete key	4
located in awkward top-row placing.	4
Letters began wearing off within four months.	0
Died within one year,	0
replacing batteries did not bring it back to life.	0
Pros : good key spring, nice size.	3

B002MUYP3E-0004
Keyboard works great.	7
However, I accidentally broke the wireless usb receiver.	7
Called logitech for a replacement	7
and they said	7
it would be a 3 month wait.	7
This pretty much renders my purchase useless.	7
Its surprising	7
that a company would fail to stock such a critical, small, and easily replaceable item.	7
Do your self a favor a purchase from another company	7

The keyboard is nice however after about a week of using the keyboard	7
I noticed	3
that the board was causing my right wrist to hurt.	3
Switching to a different keyboard	7
that could be angled properly	7
(the K340 does not have any feet	3 2
for angling the keyboard up)	3 2
my wrist stopped hurting.	7
As I said	7
the keyboard is compact and the keys feel	3
great to type on.	3
Tied with my M505 Marathon Mouse this makes a really great portable setup for work,	7
but the lack of angling and the subsequent pain has been a deal breaker.	3

B002MUYP3E-0011
I had to purchase 2 other keyboards	7
before I found this one.	7
I say	7
it is OK	7
because it is not quite as comfortable as the one	3
I was used to.	3
The space bar is long enough but not wide enough.	4
Sometimes I have to strike the space bar more than once	4
because it doesn't stand quite high enough	4
to work with my right thumb.	4
Overall I think	7
it could be a little longer	4
because the keys seem to be crowded.	4

B002MUYP3E-0012
this was a nice keyboard for its time with me.	7
As I write this review this keyboard has	7
been recently replaced.	7
It worked well but	7
as time went on the mechanical springs began to give	0
and it tended to accumulate dirt	0
and cause sticking keys. this is all normal for a keyboard so more an observation than a complaint.	3 0
It was my first wireless keyboard	7
and I believe overall it was a good purchase.	7
It lasted several years in fact	0
and used nearly 20 hours a day most every day.	0

B002MUYP3E-0017
Bought this wireless keyboard for our HTPC.	7
It is fairly light keyboard	3
and is about the size of a full size keyboard on a laptop.	5
The keys feel as good as non-wireless Logitech keyboards,	3
so I have no complaints there.	3
Also, there is no noticeable lag from the time	7
you press a key	7
and it registering on the screen.	7
We have had this keyboard for a month now	7
and have not had to change the batteries.	7
I have not verified the range for this keyboard,	1
but we keep it around 10 feet from the computer.	1
I only have a couple of minor complaints about the keyboard.	7
First, I wish	7
it had a light	7
to indicate	7
whether the NumLock is on or off.	7
Secondly, about 1 in 10 times	1
when I initially use the keyboard I have to log out and log back in	1
to get the keyboard to work.	1
I suspect	1
this may be do to the location of the RF receiver for the keyboard,	1
which is at the back of the HTPC.	1

B002MUYP3E-0027
This is a basic keyboard,	7
but it works well	7
and is pretty comfortable for me to use.	3
I type all day long on it,	7
and I haven't had any problems.	7
It works perfectly with the unified receiver	1
that I use for my Logitech mouse,	1
so I only need one receiver in my computer for both devices.	1
Some people have complained about not having the ability	7
to tilt the keyboard,	7
but I haven't found	3
that to be a problem for me -	3
it's still pretty comfortable to use.	3
All together I am very pleased with this keyboard.	7

B002MUYP3E-0050
I like these so much	7
I ordered another for work	7
to use with my laptop.	7
Unfortunately, it appears	7
Logitech is discontinuing this particular model.	7
The replacement appears to use " island " keys	7
which I dislike.	7
I like this model enough	7
that I'll probably buy a couple more refurbished units online just to keep around as spares.	7
Keyboards are largely a personal preference.	7
For me, this keyboard has the perfect size, height, tactile feel and sound, and the perfect key resistance.	3 6 4
I type faster and with fewer errors on this keyboard	3
than any I've ever used before.	7
Wireless and the batteries last a good long while.	1
Love it!	7

B002MUYP3E-0051
My fingers glide over the keys.	3
I love the feel of this keyboard.	3
It is very responsive,	3
and it looks great too.	5
For use with a PC	7
running Windows,	7
it's great!	7
I highly recommend it!	7
For a Mac, it's not quite as good	7
because of the location and size of the `` option '' and `` command '' keys	4
compared to Apple keyboards.	7
As a long-time Mac user, I make extensive use of keyboard shortcuts,	7
almost all of which require the `` command '' key.	7
On Apple keyboards, the `` command '' key is located to the immediate left of the space bar	7
and is larger than regular keys.	7
I use my left thumb on that key to type keyboard shortcuts.	7
Alas, on this keyboard, the `` command '' key is the Windows key,	4
which is the second key to the left of the space bar.	4
The key to the immediate left of the space bar is the ALT key,	4
which on a Mac is the `` option '' key.	4
Also, it is not as large as the `` command '' key on an Apple keyboard.	4
As trivial as that reason may seem,	7
it really slows me down	7
and for that reason alone,	7
I would not purchase this keyboard for a Mac.	7

B00385VWKG-0001
I bought this keyboard in hopes	8 0
that the price would reflect some kind of quality.	8 0
I was severely disappointed.	8 0
The top row of number keys all stuck right out of the box.	0
The Num-lock, 7,4,1, and zero keys stopped working after 1 hour,	0
and the down arrow quit too, then the spacebar.	0
Totally frustrated.	7
I wont be replacing this one with another.	7
I'll buy a different brand.	7
Steer clear!	7

B00385VWKG-0002
This is a compact keyboard	4
and the key layout is very poor.	4
The keys themselves do not press down well.	3 0
If you press one key then the key next to it,	0
it gets caught	0
and doesnt depress at times	0
causing typos.	7
The home key next to a half sized	4
backspace key is a total nuiscance.	4
When you think	4
you backspaced you actually hit the home key	4
sending your cursor to the beginning of the line.	7
The company	7
I bought this from was excellent, very responsive to me emails.	7
I would definately do business with them again, just not on this product.	7

B00385VWKG-0007
This keyboard is nice,	7
the response is good	3
and the keys light up and are quite legible in darkness or low light.	2
It does not have convensional format for spacing of keys.	4
Anytime you use a non letter key	4
you'll have to make use of it's visibility	4
to see	4
where the key is on the board.	4

B00385VWKG-0008
Size does matter,	7
when you're a touch typist.	7
Unfortunately, this isn't a full size keyboard, and --	4
although the size variance isn't huge --	4
many of the keys	4
aren't where they belong on a standard keyboard.	4
I purchased the Logitech white illuminated	7
and have been far happier.	7

B00385VWKG-0010
The keyboard looks nice	5
but it has a few flaws.	7
There's no mute button,	2
some of the keys are to small.	3 4
If you have a desktop	7
that you use in a darkened room,	7
you will like this keyboard	7

B00385VWKG-0013
I don't really feel the need	7
to criticize the keyboard	7
since it is,	7
and does, everything	7
the manufacturers say,	7
but I'm back to Amazon today	7
to buy a different lighted keyboard	7
and I'll keep this one for emergencies.	7
First, the positives.	7
The keyboard is sleek and visually appealing.	5
I love the blue back-lighting.	2 5
It would probably be a good keyboard	7
to take along for use with a laptop,	7
and that may have been the intent	7
because the condensed keyboard is laid out like a laptop keyboard.	4
That, unfortunately, is also part of the problem.	4
The layout of the keys makes it difficult for me to use, with keys like the backspace,	4
which I use a lot,	4
surrounded by other small keys such as Home & End,	4
which sends your cursor all over the page	7
when you hit them by mistake.	7
It's probably not the best keyboard for people	7
who do a lot of typing.	7
In fact, I plugged in my old keyboard	7
to write this review.	7
For the price, I am not displeased,	8
and it will be a good standby in case	7
I need it,	7
but for long-term use, a different keyboard is probably a better choice.	7

B00385VWKG-0016
This keyboard is awesome,	7
the light is bright	2
and makes it easy to use in dim light or dark.	2
The only problem is	7
that the keys are so close together	4
and it is not set up like most keyboards.	4
The delete, home, end, page up and down,	4
and arrow keys are all small and squished in with the rest of the keyboard keys.	4
But it was easy to hook up	1
and works great!	1

B00385VWKG-0020
I love this keyboard &	7
if I had to complain about anything at all	7
it would just be	7
that the keys are pretty loud	6
when pressed & it needs a longer cord.	1 6
The keys I can't do anything about,	7
but the cord length was easy.	7
I bought a USB extension & problem solved.	7
The back light is very bright yet easy on your eyes.	2
I use this keyboard with my PS3 slim	7
& Fatty & it works perfectly.	7

B00385VWKG-0027
Looked all over the place for this type of LED key bourd,	7
had this almost two years now,	7
for this price and the blue letters work very good in low light,	8 2
it's a lttle small	5
and fits well on top of your desk.	7

B00385VWKG-0029
I have had this item for several months now.	7
It is THE BEST keyboard	7
I have ever owned.	7
I really like the way the keyboad is illuminated.	2
Best investment in keyboards around Haven't had a single problem with it.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0000
A full size keyboard should not cause even the biggest guy	7
to feel ` fat fingered '.	7
Also the location of some of the important keys	4
(like backspace and delete)	4
are in odd places.	4
Even the space bar is tiny.	4
I definitely would not recommend this for gaming or a lot of typing.	7
I like the backlight though.	2

B003Y7ZBDM-0002
I bought this for a customer,	7
and	7
when I plugged it in,	7
the PC acted	0
like the Control key was constantly pressed,	0
so I couldn't type the letter f	7
without causing a search	7
to start on the PC.	7
The keyboard also feels flimsy	3
when typing on it.	3
If you want a backlit keyboard,	2
I recommend spending a bit more money	7
and getting the Logitech Gaming Keyboard G105.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0003
Dad wanted a keyboard	7
he could see at night	7
without his lights on in the house other than a little desk lamp.	7
They keys are TOO close together more so than any keyboard	4
any of my family has used.	7
This didn't work	7
so we pitched	7
it and he went back to his old keyboard	7
without a light.	7
I surely wouldn't recommend this piece of work to anyone.	7
I mean what good is a keyboard	7
if some of the keys don't work?????	7
None of the lighted keyboards I checked out	7
when I bought	7
this had very good reviews	7
but for Dad I bought one anyway.	7
What a waste of time and money.	8
May God bless.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0012
This keyboard looks very sleek	5
and I love the lit keys.	2
But the arrangement of this keyboard is absolutely awful,	4
which pretty severely reduces its usability.	3
This is NOT a " full sized " standard keyboard.	4
The keys are smaller	4
and the keyboard is compressed.	4
The half-sized delete key with the Home button right next to it is particularly egregious.	4
I've had this keyboard for well over a year now	7
and even though I spend many hours a day	7
using it,	7
I'm still not used to it	7
(I've had	7
to make multiple corrections on this review).	7
I'm basically fed up	7
and will be buying a replacement soon.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0016
This is a pretty good keyboard for the price.	8
The backlit keys look great	2 5
and there aren't any issues	7
to speak of.	7
But	7
if you want a full sized keyboard,	4
this isn't what you 're	4
looking for.	4
Not sure	7
why it's listed as full sized	7
as I think anyone	7
looking for a quality compact keyboard would be thrilled with this item.	7
Otherwise, a solid device.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0022
The illumination of the keys is perfect.	2
They're not too bright or too dim.	2
The blue color of the illumination is beautiful as well.	2
I can use this keyboard in a dark room.	2
It is a little smaller than other keyboards but not significanly so.	4
I didn't find	7
it's smaller size	4
to be uncomfortable or inconvenient.	3
On the downside, the keys are noisy, giggly,	6
and feel cheap.	3
So I gave it three out of five stars.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0029
This keyboard is nice and bright, plug and play and easy to use.	1
The price is also right.	8
If you're a gamer like me	7
and just need a little light for your keys to find your bearings sometime,	2
this will work for you.	7
I had to take a star off	7
because they made the keyboard compact	4
and cut the size of the back/delete key.	4
This is really annoying for non gaming or word	7
processing	7
as you will miss the key often	7
if you 're	7
used to a standard keyboard.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0037
The keys are a little clackety for my taste	3
but then again I don't do a whole lot	7
of typing on it anyway.	7
The keys are backlit in a soft blue	2
that isn't too overwhelming.	2
It does have a button	2
to turn the backlight function off	2
but if you do	7
that you won't be able to see the lettering on the keys at all.	7
It has a variety of other useful function buttons	2
including volume buttons for the sound.	2
The only thing	7
I don't like about this keyboard	4
is the enter key	4
is a little smaller than on most boards	4
and the backspace key is very small, the same size as the letter keys.	4
Other than that, I like	7
it ok.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0046
I purchased this keyboard	7
because I like to surf the web right before go to sleep	7
and usually the lights are off.	7
Even though I can type	7
without looking at the keyboard...	7
it was still a little hard to type with the lights off.	7
So I looked up some backlit keyboards	7
and saw	7
that this one had some good reviews.	7
I like the blue LED color.	2
It's bright enough to see,	2
but not too bright in the dark.	2
You can also turn the lights on and off.	2
They keyboard has a great feel,	3
but I have one complaint.	7
They say	7
it's a full size keyboard,	7
but it feels a little smaller than a full size.	4
It feels	3
like the size is between a full size keyboard and a laptop computer.	3 4
I guess	7
I just wish	4
the backspace button was a little larger...	4
I'm always	7
missing it!	7
Haha.	7
But for the price you are getting a great product	8
and I would recommend it to anyone	7
looking for a backlit keyboard.	7

B003Y7ZBDM-0047
Great product at a good price.	8
Works as described.	7
I would recommend it to anyone	7
looking for a product such as this.	7
The blue lit keyboard is the best looking	2 5
that I have seen.	7

B004HFLRUQ-0000
Have tried to work with this for a couple of months with my iMac Intel.	7
It is never discoverable by the computer	1
and	7
when it can be used	1
it takes some time for it to wake up	1
and provide service.	1
The help from the manufacturer is very poor	7
and I'm disgusted with them and this nasty piece of work.	7

B004HFLRUQ-0007
This keyboard was very nice looking	5
and worked well at first.	7
I found out	7
that there is no cut off switch	2
and the keyboard does	2
not auto shut off	2
so the battery does not last more than one day.	7
I ended up	7
throwing it away	7
and getting a totally different keyboard.	7

B004HFLRUQ-0008
I got this keyboard	8
when it was discounted to $ 8.95.	8
And it's probably only worth that much.	8
It frequently looses the bluetooth connection with my MacBook Pro	1
and drops the key presses, especially with the space bar.	0
So I keep on editing what type.	7
Also key are a bit harder to press,	3
and the contact connections may not always work,	0
resulting in skipped characters on the screen.	0
There are better keyboards for the price.	8

B004HFLRUQ-0011
I like the size of this keyboard.	5
But it went to sleep too much	2
to save battery.	2
It got to be annoying to wake it up in the middle	2
of reading an article.	2
Also, too much lag	1
if you type fast.	1
I sold it	7
and got a hard-wired Apple keyboard	7
that is no longer made,	7
but still can be found online.	7

B004HFLRUQ-0020
I bought this as a replacement for a PC keyboard I was using	7
that was way too loud.	7
This one	1
connected fine	1
and works well enough.	7
It's small and attractive.	5
My only complaint is	7
that the keys are loose	0
-	7
they kind of wobble	0
where they sit,	0
which gives it a cheapish feel,	3 0
makes the fingers a bit unsure	3
of where to sit	3
and makes using the keyboard louder	6
than it needs to be.	6

B004HFLRUQ-0022
It's a good enough product,	7
I should say.	7
Sleek looking,	5
flat buttons,	5
I like it.	7
Just few minor problems.	7
It loses its connection sometimes	1
and it causes a little delay.	1
Also, I get double with one click sometimes.	7
For example,	7
if I type ` have ',	7
it shows as ` havee '.	7
It's not me	7
who is doing it!	7
But overall, I'm satisfied.	7
This might not be the one for heavy user.	7

B004HFLRUQ-0025
This keyboard worked	7
as promised.	7
It easily connects to my iPad and Droidx.	1
The price is right.	8
My only complaint is the lack of a proper on/off switch.	2
I travel a lot	7
and unless I remove the batteries	7
it comes on in my suitcase	7
and I end up with dead batteries.	7

B004HFLRUQ-0026
I use this keyboard	7
when my mac is hooked up to my TV	7
so I can surf the web in bed.	7
They keyboard works great and syncs up quickly.	1
The only thing	7
I'd have to warn people about is	7
that the keys are a bit stiff.	3
Hard to the touch.	3
Nothing like the keys on my mac,	3
so it takes a little	7
getting used to.	7
I wouldn't say its a bad thing, or a deal breaker in any way,	7
but it does loose a few points in that area.	7

B004HFLRUQ-0029
I work on my phone,	7
so this is wonderful, i had checked apple	7
and almost spent twice the price, of course this one is plastic	8 0
but it works just great none the less. i have had mine over a year	0
and it still is working great,	0
only drawback is the on and off button is so tiny	2
that it is hard to slide,	2
but hey use	7
a pen and dont complain.	7

B004HFLRUQ-0032
This a very nice product.	7
True, the case is plastic.	5 0
But the front panel is aluminum.	5 0
The keys are smooth	3
and feel like rubber, the same as the Apple keyboard.	3
They click nicely.	3
Side by side with the Apple keyboard,	7
you can see the characters on the Azio keys are printed in boldface.	7
They are much more legible.	7
Otherwise, I can barely tell one from the other.	7
What are you other reviewers smoking?	7

B004HVW0ZQ-0000
I was excited about using this keyboard	7
for when I was traveling and using my tablet.	7
I liked ergonomics and the lightness	3 4
and all was well...	7
until the 3d time I tried to use it.	7
Dead.	0
Changed batteries,	0
made no difference.	0
It had not been banged around	0
and no reason for this to happen.	0
Can't recommend this item!	7

B004HVW0ZQ-0002
The keyboard itself has good reactivity	3
and is light and portable.	3
However, I am very, very disappointed in the durability of this product.	0
I have owned it for less than two months	0
and the key for the `` t '' is already broken.	0
I have to afix back to the keyboard now every time I go to type.	0
I have been gently using this keyboard,	0
transporting it in a heavy leather briefcase,	7
so this is rather poor craftsmanship.	0
I have noted	7
that the return policy has convieniently expired at the end of April	7
(two weeks after I am writing this review).	7
I will have to pursue the warranty at Microsoft	7
now unless someone reasonable from Amazon reads this	7
(crossing my fingers here).	7
Bottom line :	7
avoid this product due to durability issues.	0

B004HVW0ZQ-0003
This keyboard is very hard to type on and will cause your wrists to ache.	3
It lays flat	3
rather than have some level of angle.	3
Also, the bluetooth connection turns off after a certain amount of inactivity,	1
which caused intermittent delays	1
while I was writing.	1
For example, I'd type a paragraph,	7
go back	7
and read it,	7
maybe think for a minute,	7
and when I went back to type again I would get a delayed reaction, sometimes for 10 or more seconds	1
until the connection would re-establish.	1
This was even more annoying	7
when surfing the web.	7
Sometimes I wouldn't be able to use my keyboard to type in my password	1
to log in to the computer, very annoying.	1
I liked the idea of not having to have a USB wireless receiver for my keyboard and mouse,	7
but the reality is	7
that this solution is too uncomfortable and unreliable.	1 3
I would not recommend this product.	7

B004HVW0ZQ-0006
I've tried a few of these keyboards,	7
and they all have constant connection problems.	1
The layout is nice,	4
and the action is ok.	3
Good for typing	3
if it could stay	1
connected.	1
All 3	1
I've tried	1
have connection problems with multiple computers	1
while 4 other bluetooth keyboards have never had similar connection problems.	7
The connection problems are unique to the Microsoft bluetooth keyboards.	1
I'm a big fan of the feel of the keyboard,	3
but I'd never risk getting another one of these because of the annoying connection problems.	1
I actually had better luck with the wireless	7
(non-bluetooth) version.	7

B004HVW0ZQ-0014
This is probably the most comfortable keyboard	3
I've ever used.	3
The slight curvature in the middle of the keyboard makes for a more relaxed typing position,	3
without being too exaggerated like the " split " keyboards	3
that have a gap	7
running top-to-bottom through the keyboard with an upward angle	7
that strains my wrists.	7
The slim depth of this keyboard helps keep my wrists relaxed, as well.	3
The big issue with this keyboard is	1
that it loses the bluetooth connection with my laptop on a regular basis.	1
I have to uninstall/reinstall the keyboard sometimes as often as a few times per month.	7
I don't have any problems with other bluetooth devices,	7
so I assume	7
it is something with the keyboard.	7
I don't know	7
if it is the actual keyboard or the software	1
(drivers).	7
If this keyboard wasn't so comfortable to type on,	3
I would have sent it back.	7

B004HVW0ZQ-0017
I purchased a Bluetooth dongle for my laptop	7
and was able to connect quickly and without a hitch via Windows 7 to this elegant but spare keyboard.	1
The keyboard works very well.	7
It is slim and lightweight with a curved ergonomic-type design	3 5
that Microsoft calls `` comfort curve ''.	7
It's stylish too, with an all black keyboard, matte keys and rubberized rim.	5
One of the things	7
I noticed right off	7
is that	7
despite the slender profile, it stays put on my desk, no slipping or sliding or rocking.	3
It's solid.	7
The key action is responsive	3
without being overly `` clicky ''	6
and I am able to type rapidly and accurately.	7
Time will tell about battery longevity,	7
which was a problem with a Bluetooth keyboard	7
I owned some years back.	7
The AAA batteries were included in the box,	7
which is always appreciated.	7
My only complaint about this product is that typically,	7
when things work well,	7
there is no need for information or support.	7
If you are having difficulty	7
coupling your equipment to this keyboard,	7
there is very little information	7
provided to help.	7

B004HVW0ZQ-0024
A beautiful keyboard	5
which if you get it for a deal	8
is well worth it.	7
I take it with me on vacation	7
to use with my bluetooth tablet or phone.	7
One could put a bluetooth adapter in a netbook	7
and get a much more comfortable keyboard.	3
I have not ever liked the Microsoft keyboards	7
which were contoured	7
and had a break in the middle between the G and the H.	7
I learned typing in high school	7
and those keyboards slow me down.	7
This one fits the way	3
your fingers would naturally sit.	3
Each row is on a bit of a curve upward at the ends	4
just as all my Logitech keyboards have been.	7

B004HVW0ZQ-0030
The keyboard works perfectly.	7
It connected easily to my Surface Pro tablet.	1
It sleeps	2
when not in use	2
so I expect the batteries to last for quite a while.	2
The layout is a bit unusual	4
and will take a little	4
getting used to.	4
It replaces a full size PC keyboard	7
I used on a desktop	7
which died.	7
It is more suited to my limited space	7
than the standard keyboard was.	7
Keys are smooth	3
and the ergonomic placement of keys is nice.	3

B004HVW0ZQ-0044
I initially bought a cheap keyboard	7
(the Anker)	7
and I received a defective unit.	7
After returning it I decided	7
that it was worth another $ 15 for a high quality product.	7
I absolutely do not regret it.	7
I've had zero problems	1
with pairing and connecting this keyboard,	1
and the key feel is very good for such a thin keyboard.	3
The build	0
quality seems very good as well.	0
My only complaint is	2
that some flip-out feet would be nice,	2
but those always seem to break anyway.	7

Getting a wireless keyboard will change the way	7
you interact with your tablet	7
(or if you're ambitious, your mobile phone).	7
The price for most of these seems to be around $ 60,	7
which was too rich for me,	7
but the $ 30 this cost me was just about right.	8
Yet,	7
despite it being considerably cheaper than other keyboards,	8
the build	0
quality is solid.	0
I've lugged this around all over and have typed several 2000 word + blog posts on it easily.	7
Love the travel	7
and works well with my iPad.	7
Only gripe with it is it's not always clear	7
when it's out of battery vs. just not connecting quite right,	1
but most of the time I keep it paired to the same device	1
and this isn't an issue.	7

Pros :	7
It's cheap and a little quieter than a regular keyboard.	8 6
Cons :	7
It's not silent.	6
It died less than 5 months	0
after I bought it.	0
The Rosewill website helpfully says	7
the warranty is " Repair Only ".	7
Unfortunately, the postage charges mean	7
it's not worth sending this back to Rosewill for repair.	7
I would write more but really,	7
it's a keyboard	7
that's a little quieter than others.	6
It hasn't changed my life, solved general relativity	7
or provided answers about the meaning of life.	7
It died	0
and isn't worth replacing.	7
Even Tolstoy couldn't do much with that.	7

I would purchase this keyboard in a heartbeat	7
if it weren't for one thing : the ridiculous layout of the navigation keys between the QWERTY and numeric keypad.	4
I really wish	7
manufacturers would stop	7
trying to re-invent the wheel with keyboard layouts.	7
I have been	7
using the same PC-AT layout for 25 years	7
I am not about to change.	7
Can they not recognise	7
that muscle memory exists with a vast majority of their customer base?	7
Rather than having a 3x2 grid they have messed everything up by converting it into a 2x3 grid.	7
Bad monkey.	7
No banana.	7

About the only thing this keyboard has going for it is its price.	8
I was looking for a thin, basic keyboard	7
that wouldn't make	7
me arch my wrists	7
when I type.	7
Keyboard seemed to occasionally miss button presses	3
and was just generally fairly inaccurate.	7
Replaced it with a slightly more expensive K120 from Logitech	7
and find it to be much better,	7
even though it is a little thicker with more travel in the keys.	7
I also have a Logitech solar K750	7
that is even thinner than the Rosewell	7
and I also much prefer its typing characteristics and accuracy,	7
though it is much more expensive and not in the same league.	7

I really liked the keyboard.	7
It was a replacement to my apple keyboard	7
because I am forced to use a Windows rig for the next couple months.	7
I liked the feel of the keys	3
however the keyboard died for no reason after three weeks.	0
I guess	7
sometimes a penny saved	7
is a pound foolish.	7
Bad buy.	7
However Amazon allowed me to return	7
even though I've had it for a month.	7
I love Amazon!	7

That's all	6
you hear with this keyboard	6
- a loud ticking/clacking noise as you type.	6
It works well,	7
but	7
if you want something quiet,	6
this isn't it.	6
It's also somewhat bulky,	3
but for the price	8
you get	8
what you pay for.	7
It works, no bells or whistles.	7

I've had this for at least a year	7
and have used it as a second keyboard	7
when I'm out of town.	7
I am used to the apple numerical chiclet keyboard,	7
and so I always fumble the keys with this one	7
because the windows key is not the same as the option/apple key etc..	4
Keyboard copy/paste keys are different too between the apple and this one.	4
So switching back and fourth takes some getting used to.	7
The key profile on this keyboard is low, much better than the traditional keyboard full depth keys, but not as low as the apple,	3
and the typing doesn't have the satisfying punchy clickyness	3
that I really like with the apple keyboard.	7
It also doesn't have the USB connection in the keyboard.	1
However, the winner-take-all here is the price.	8
For the apple keyboard you pay a lot of money, for this,	7
it's very cheap.	8
So if you have a tight budget,	7
and if you don't plan to switch back and fourth	7
but would get used to this keyboard and the copy/paste/windows button,	7
then it will work fine with a mac	7
and be a good keyboard.	7

It is my own fault	7
but the only thing	7
I wish for on this	7
is some media buttons such as volume,	2 4
since I am using it in a set up with a macbook pro	7
and dont want to have to reach to my laptop	7
to control the volume,	7
but that wasn't in the design.	7
It feels a bit cheap	0
but what do	8
you expect at the price.	8
In general functionality is good for a simple small chiclet keyboard.	7

I recently switched from a mac with a low profile stainless steel keyboard to a great new PC,	7
except the keyboard was one of those high keyed, clackety-clunkety types.	7
Hated it.	7
This keyboard,	7
while not as low profile as the mac board,	7
is great.	7
Solid feel, quick response, and quiet.	3 6
Purchase with confidence.	7

B006CSKLO4-0026
For $ 10, this isn't bad at all.	8
Very nice keyboard with very responsive keys.	3
They're kinda loud,	6
but meh I don't care.	7
I spilt water on it a few days ago	0
and It's still working perfectly so	0
that's pretty awesome. 5 stars.	7

B006CSKLO4-0028
This keyboard does everything	7
a keyboard should.	7
It is comfortable to use,	3
it is quiet,	6
and it is very reliable.	0
Also, at such a good price it is hard to beat!	8
I definitely recommend it.	7
