The photo online and on the card	4
attached to the case shows foam.	4
Where is it?	4
I don't have any foam included.	4
There is NO way this thin! thin! thin! case would protect a pencil let alone a heavy laptop.	6
Don't waste your money.	4
Mine goes back tomorrow!	4

B0000A2QBX-0001
I purchased this case	4
because it looked very functional...	4
To my surprise the rivets popped out and the zipper broke about two weeks into it's use.	7
I have never been disappointed by a Sampsonite product until now.	4
I have written to them	1
and received no communication in return!	1

B0000A2QBX-0004
I use this case on a daily basis	4
and have used it for about five months and by then both strap attachments	2 7
and the handle broke	2 7
and I am already having to look for a new case.	4
If you are going to use this daily buy something that	7
is of better quality.	7
It looks nice	3
and is not very bulky	4
but will brake due to poor quality.	7

B0000A2QBX-0012
I bought	4
this case for Dell Inspiron E1505	4
(15. 4 '')	4
screen.	4
It was way too small.	8
This case has an inner pocket,	0
which is the actual spot for the laptop	4
to slip in.	4
I will say	4
it can only fit a 14 '' screen.	8
I ended up	4
putting my laptop outside the inner pocket,	8
which barely fit.	8
I wish	4
the manufacturer noticed this problem and not listed for any 15 '' + screens.	4

B0000A2QBX-0014
I really liked this bag.	4
It has room for power cables and a few other small things.	0
I had it for over a year	4
but only used it occasionally.	4
Unfortunately over the holidays the hand strap broke.	2 7
Great buy, just be careful with the straps.	2 7

B0000A2QBX-0018
The case itself looks pretty high quality,	7
but it's too thin.	8
Getting the laptop in and out of the case is a huge hassle	8
requiring both hands and lots	4
of pulling.	4
I have a 15. 4 '' Widescreen Dell Dimensions 1501.	4
It fits in there snug,	8
but as I stated above, getting the computer in and out is pain	8
(my wife is trying to convince me to return it,	4
but I'm too lazy,	4
I think	4
we'll just keep it).	4
Also,	4
if you have a wireless mouse,	8
it bulges out.	8
Again, it has to do with the case	8
being so thin.	8
To some this characteristic may be very desirable	4
because the case is very low profile,	4
but	4
if you have perfiferals like a wireless mouse or a A/C adapter	4
that is more than an inch thick,	4
it bulges out.	4
There's padding, of course,	6
so your periferals probably will not be damaged...	6
it just looks kinda funny.	3

B0000A2QBX-0023
I bought this case at the recomendation of a friend.	4
The size of the case is great,	8
it even fits under te seat on smaller airplanes.	8
I do not need a lot of space for extras,	8 0
so this is the perfect size.	8
The padding is good	4
and it is quite stylish. there is just enough size for a mouse, power cord, a fre CD's and a cell phone.	8 3
I love the styling and details,	3
it is well thought out.	4
There is although one drawback.	4
My machine is just shy of the maximum size	4
allowed by th specs.	4
There is a pouch inside for the computer,	8
and it is a tight fit	8
to put it in.	4
This is a definite drawback,	4
but given the opportunity I would buy the same one again.	4

B0000A2QBX-0034
Functionality wise : awesome!	4
Has room for a lot of stuff,	8
and keeps the computer really protected,	6
and that's the most important feature a case	4
like that can have.	4
Doesn't look shiny and fancy, though,	3
and it's something	4
I look	4
for in everything I buy.	4
But it varies from a person to another, obviously.	4
Anyway I recommend.	4

B0000A2QBX-0038
I love this bag	4
and I am so glad	4
that I ordered it.	4
I shopped around	4
for a few weeks and nothing is as good as this.	4
The quality of the bag is outstanding.	7
The design is perfect to fit the laptop, batteries, pens, paperwork, etc..	0
The padding inside really keeps the laptop secure.	6
Other laptop bags	4
that I saw	4
were either bulky or super expensive.	4
The price on Amazon is great	5
however I would have definately paid more	4
given what is out there currently.	4
If you are considering this product	4
look no further	4
because this is what you have	4
been looking for!	4

B0000A2QBX-0069
Very happy with the Samsonite L35 Notebook Case.	4
Fits my MacBook with plenty of room.	8
Lots of pokets for my mouse, mouse pad, and accessories.	0
Just the right size	8
for what I wanted.	4
Nice looking, and well built.	7 3

B0009JR5K0-0000
From the picture on Amazon this product appeared to be of good quality.	7
Four	7
(4) weeks	7
after we purchased the item some of the stripping at the bottom of the bag	7
peeled off.	7
I was unable to return the item	1
because I had it just over the four weeks.	1
I decided to keep the product and about 3 weeks from that date, one	4
(1) of the handles broke on the item	2 7
and left me with just the one handle	2 7
to lift the item with.	2
Five	7
(5) months later the last handle finally broke off the product.	2 7
I used this bag solely for the purpose	4
of carrying my laptop	4
and supplies.	4
I am very disappointed in the quality of item	7
given the amount of money requested.	5

B0009JR5K0-0003
I purchased this rolling bag about six months ago.	4
I travel frequently for work	4
and depend on this bag	4
to get me through airports and into and out of schools.	4
The telescoping handle	2 7
stopped retracting about a month ago	2 7
and an airline agent showed me how to push the little button in the rear compartment	4
to free the mechanism.	4
Picture lots of people	4
waiting as I unzipped the bag	4
to fool with the handle on shuttle buses, in airline aisles, etc..	4
Then last week	4
the black plastic handle	2 7
that is supposed to cradle inside the other handle	2 7
snapped off the bag	2 7
as a bus driver lifted it.	4
I am going to contact Kensington about a refund	4
because the bag is still under warrantee.	4
I do not want a replacement	4
unless the bag has been redesigned.	4
I really liked that vertical design of this bag	8
because it could be pulled down aisles in planes.	4

B0009JR5K0-0005
BOTH handles on this case have broken.	2 7
The plastic handles can not stand up to normal wear	2 7
and tear.	2 7
The case was not too bad,	4
but now it is useless.	4
I will be returning it to Kensington.	4

B0009JR5K0-0007
I've used this once	4
and it really didn't meet my expectations.	4
I've been	4
looking for a carry on bag	4
that works for me	4
and this isn't it.	4
Besides that, it's already	7
starting to fall apart.	7

B0009JR5K0-0008
The basic concept and design would rate five stars if execution were not flawed.	4
The zipper pulls sacrifice function and durability for style.	7 3
In the course of just one trip to Asia, have already had one pull come off.	7
The bag could also use a shoulder strap for those inevitable situations	2
(climbing stairs	4
and negotiating narrow aisles)	4
when you can't roll the thing.	4

B0009JR5K0-0011
There were several things	4
I liked about this bag.	4
Shoe storage on each side of the handle is a smart use of space.	0
The pockets made sense as well.	0
So nice organization in this bag I returned it	4
because I just didn't like the look	3
and needed more room for clothing and less for files.	0
This bag might be better suited to men then women.	4
Just personal preference.	4

B0009JR5K0-0017
The Kensington laptop case has good protection for a laptop.	6
There is sufficient space	4
to carry laptop accessories and a daytimer, folders, a jacket or raincoat, noise reduction earphones and munchies for the road.	8 0
I'm pleased with it	4
and recommend it for road warriors	4
who travel frequently,	4
as I do.	4
The only drawback is having to leave it plane-side for small planes.	4

B0009JR5K0-0020
I needed a laptop bag with wheels	4
since I was tired of carrying around my heavy bookbag at the airport	4
... this one is great,	4
so many compartments,	0
the wide-set wheels help prevent it from tipping over,	4
and the handle is comfortable.	2
My only complaint is the finishing strip on the back side at the base came off very quickly,	7
but I didn't really care that much.	4

B0009JR5K0-0026
This bag is incredible	4
if you have a 17 inch laptop.	8
It's so hard	4
to find a good bag	8
that'll fit my enormous laptop,	8
and this one more than fits the bill.	8
It has a really comfortable handle	2
if you need	4
to carry it,	4
and has so many hidden pockets	0
and places to put things.	0
I love it,	4
and can't say enough about it.	4
The quality is also excellent.	7
I highly recommend getting one.	4
It's worth the price.	5

B0009JR5K0-0028
I 've	4
been looking for a carry-on bag	4
that would accommodate my laptop, some clothing and personnel items.	4
This is a well made bag	7
and is a dream to roll thru the airport.	4
It has many little compartments to pack almost anything.	0
A separate center compartment unzips to pull out the laptop for security at the airport.	0
I had been using a laptop backpack	4
to carry my computer and peripherals	4
which got extremely heavy after long periods	4
of hauling around.	4
The price is great	5
compared to other bags with these same features.	5

B000VB7EFW-0002
I was very disappointed with this backpack.	4
It says	4
it fits a 17inch notebook,	8
however it did not.	8
It is always a hassle	1
to return Christmas gifts -	1
not that it was difficult through Amazon	1
(very easy and hassle free) -	1
just the hassle	4
of packing up	4
and going to the post office.	4

B000VB7EFW-0003
First time I have	4
been dissappointed with a product from Amazon.	4
Appearantly others are	4
having the same problem with a 17 '' laptop not fitting in the compartment.	8
My laptop is a standard size in the market.	4
The bag may look good	3
but that doesn't help if laptop doesn't fit.	8
Totally dissappointed with SwissGear and Amazon.	1

B000VB7EFW-0007
We bought	4
this as a good price. that is all	5
I can say.	4
The laptop	8
we have	8
doesn't fit in it.	8
And	4
after using the pack for less than a month,	4
it is ripping out already.	7
Definatly would not purchase again	4
and would not recomend.	4

B000VB7EFW-0009
Like a dummy I ordered it after reading	4
that it doesn't fit some of the 17 '' models.	8
I have an HP	4
and it doesnt fit.	8
On the plus side it does have a lot of nooks and crannies to put stuff in.	0
Just disappointed to find out my laptop doesn't fit.	8
Need to leave it unzipped.	4
Just build it a tad bit bigger	8
and send my one for my idea.	4
You'll have the best on the market!	4
Nice try ` eh	4

B000VB7EFW-0010
This is a very well made bag, nice construction, lots of pockets.	7 0
The pocket for the media player is on the inside of the bag	0
and there's a connector there as well with the wire running down through the bag strap to a connector outside of the bag for you	0
to use with your headphones with.	0
The bad thing about this bag is	8
that it barely fits my xps m1710	8
and my HP Pavilion DV7-3080US cant fit at all,	8
which is a big disappointment.	8

B000VB7EFW-0013
I was really excited to get this backpack	4
because I had been carefully searching for a backpack	4
that had to fit my 17 inch laptop.	8
I received my SwissGear backpack	4
and really loved all of the pockets, padded straps,	2 0
all the compartments	0
it had	4
and the durability of the fabric and the price was right.	5 7
In the stores, this backpack would have been at least double the price.	5
But,	4
when I tried to fit my laptop in the compartment	8
it was supposed to go in,	8
it didn't fit.	8
I was really disappointed	4
because everything else about this backpack was really nice.	4
I was able to fit it in another compartment	8
which fits snug,	8
but it doesn't have the padding or strap	2
that is supposed	4
to hold it in place.	4
I did decide to just keep the backpack	4
because of all of it's other features and other uses	4
I have for it and it's ability	0
to hold my laptop in another compartment.	0

B000VB7EFW-0020
I love this backpack.	4
The quality is excellent	7
and I love all the pockets and compartments.	0
I have a 15. 4 '' widescreen laptop	4
and it fits great.	8
However,	4
because my laptop is 6. 4lbs and the backpack is 6lbs,	4
the weight can add up fast.	4
I have a lot of textbooks for school and the weight of everything usually averages 40lbs.	4
Granted,	4
the bag holds it all very well with room to spare	4
and it is very durable.	7
I bought the bag a couple years ago	3
and it still looks brand new.	3
I've also used the bag for weekend camping	4
(minus the laptop)	4
and can fit all my clothes	8
and whatnot in it --	8
I love	8
how much	8
stuff it can hold.	8
Also,	4
once I have the bag on my back,	4
the straps are very comfortable.	2
It's just not the lightest backpack	4
to swing on your shoulder	4
and run out the door.	4

B000VB7EFW-0023
My 15. 6 '' HP Pavilion dv6-1360US	4
(14. 9 `` X10. 15 `` X1.33 '')	4
barely fit inside the protective slot for laptop in this bag!	8
When I put my laptop in the protective slot,	8
the laptop get very close to the zipper,	8
and the laptop pushes against the top of the bag	8
(I can see laptop corners through the bag).	8
I have to be VERY careful to zip it to make sure	8
that the zipper does not scratch my laptop.	8
I am a little worried	4
about carrying weight in the bag	4
because it will press against the laptop.	4
The bag does have a bigger space by the protective slot.	6 0
It is big enough for my laptop,	8
but does not have any cushion on the sides	4
(there is a little cushion at the bottom).	4
I may put my laptop here	4
by adding some cushion	4
if I feel too uncomfortable	4
about putting my laptop in the protective slot.	4
Other than this, the bag appears to be rugged and well made.	7
We initially had trouble	4
unzipping the bag	4
because some zipper teeth were not aligned.	4
But	4
after we pushed them in,	4
it works fine.	4
As other reviewers noticed,	4
the mp3 slot is inside the bag.	0
Don't know how useful that it.	0

B000VB7EFW-0028
I purchased this bag for my husband.	4
He is a supervisor	4
and carries his laptop everywhere.	4
He LOVES this bag	4
and can't beleive the price	5
we were able to get it for on Amazon.com.	4
We have seen this same bag out in the stores for close to $ 100.	5
It is very well made	7
and protects everything inside.	6
If you are even	4
thinking about buying this bag -	4
GET IT!	4

B000VB7EFW-0029
This is a well constructed product	7
made of quality materials.	7
The color is a true red	3
as I thought	4
it would be	4
and not a hot pink as it appears in the ad.	3
I have read a lot of different opinions	4
about what size laptop fits in it.	8
I have a Sony Vaio	4
that measures 15?1/8 inches long	4
and it fits nicely.	8
I'm not sure	8
that it would fit	8
if it were much longer.	8
It has many pockets for just about anything	0
you might want to carry	0
while traveling.	0
Not sure	4
why I had to pay more for it than the blue or black?	5

B00307F8PW-0000
It looks good,	3
BUT the smell is really bad.	7
After I read the tag saying :	4
this item uses the chemical	7
that may cause cancer, birth defect, and reproductive harm!	7
I shoveled it into the box	4
and return it immediately!	4

B00307F8PW-0001
Crap.	4
The " leather " is already peeling,	7
and the straps are small..	2
I can barely sling it over my shoulder.	2
It will fit a lap top.. and that is about it.	8
Head to TJ Maxx/Ross	4
and find something better	4

B00307F8PW-0004
This bag is very padded,	6
has lots of compartments and space, BUT,	8 0
it's too HEAVY.	4
Also the straps on this bag are so firm	2
that they don't bend easily.	2
This causes my shoulders to hurt after only a few minutes.	2
I stopped using it.	4
Will have to search for something better.	4

B00307F8PW-0005
This is a nice big bag, and super cheap,	5
but I wanted something	4
that wasn't so obviously plastic.	7
I also didn't like the stitching.	7
Just looked cheap.	7
Sent it back.	4

B00307F8PW-0007
I bought this bag for my 17 inch laptop..	4
Fits perfectly!	8
I have an extended battery on my laptop	4
and this bag can fit my laptop, the charger, a few notebooks, pencils, pens, and few other small items.	8
It definetly does its job well.	4
It is a nice bag	4
my only thing is	4
that on the edges it	7
starting to peel a bit.. perhaps Its	7
from rubbing	4
on my jeans or just getting	4
thrown around a bit..	4
I take good care of my stuff..	4
Its better than nothing.	4
For the price its good..	5
It doesnt compare to a nice leather bag..	4
The price also doesnt compare to that of a leather bag..	5
Overall, its a great bag.	4
Does what its supposed to do.	4
Sender sent quickly.. :)	4

B00307F8PW-0008
Decently sized bag, a bit taller	8
than I had anticipated.	8
Serves its purpose just fine	4
and I'm content with the look of it.	3
The biggest problem is the straps.	2
They're made from some sort of really stiff material.	2 7
You can easily scrape/burn yourself	2
if you're not careful,	2
or it'll hurt	2
if it digs into your shoulder the wrong way.	2
Like others	4
have mentioned, it does smell.	4
Protip : Do not leave a ziploc of crackers in there for more than a day or two.	4
It will acquire the smelly essence of this bag	4
when you later retrieve it.	4
You will taste it,	4
and you will not like it.	4

B00307F8PW-0021
Bought this as my back up bag b/c	4
I am tough on my bags.	4
I bought to use for my court briefcase	4
to bring legal sized files in.	4
Seems very durable and a good size.	8 7
Haven't used it much yet though but I am happy with it so far!	4

B00307F8PW-0022
It looks exactly like the picture	3
and works great.	4
Has a couple pockets	0
inside that are convenient	0
and is definitely large enough	8
to hold such a large laptop.	8
Definitely a great value!!!	5

B00307F8PW-0037
I am very picky about bags, purses, etc..	4
And a bag	4
for carrying my macbook pro in is not something	4
to be taken lightly :)	4
After reading very helpful reviews on this I decided to give it a try and so glad	4
I did.	4
I love the material on the outside	7
and it's very spacious for my 15 '' laptop and other books, folders for school.	8
The ONLY complaint is	4
that I wish	0
it had small pockets on the outside for my phone, wallet, keys instead of one huge pocket	0
where I find myself digging for those things.	4
But that is just me complaining,	4
because this is a really great buy.	4

B00307F8PW-0043
This bag is great	4
because it works for a larger laptop.	8
Also, it has a zipper,	0
so you don't have to worry about things	4
falling out of the bag.	4
I use this daily at work	4
because I often have to change meeting rooms/work areas.	4
This bag comfortably fits a laptop, notebooks, pens, etc..	8
It also has little metal " feet " so	4
that the bag will sit upright	4
when you put it on the floor.	4
The outside pocket is handy,	0
but it also has pockets inside for 3 pens, and then 2 larger pockets,	0
which I use for my iphone and smaller items.	4
There's a zippered pocket inside as well.	0
I have a 17 " monitor	4
and looked everywhere for a case	4
that would work.	4
This one works great	4
and looks cute.	3

B0038KLD50-0001
I started using this bag in July	4
to carry my laptop to and from work.	4
Three months later and the strap ripped.	2 7
I only carry the laptop and a few papers,	4
I can't understand how a laptop bag could be so cheaply made.	7
It's a good thing	6
that it has good padding, otherwise,	6
it would've damaged the computer.	6
Very dissappointed.	4
I've contacted Case Logic,	4
we'll see what happens.	4

B0038KLD50-0002
I want to be clear,	4
the vendor	4
that I purchased this hunk of junk from stood up for it	4
and supplied a perfect replacement at no extra charge.	4
As far as the Case Logic bag	4
though I was severely disappointed.	4
I researched for a long time to find what I thougt	4
would be a good bag for my needs.	4
This bag was it	4
until I received it.	4
It came in with a defective zipper	7
and I tried twice to contact the manufacturer Case Logic,	1
and they never even responded.	1
This from a consumer standpoint really turned me off from even considering a Case Logic in the future.	1
I will also never recommend their product to anyone.	4
I will however say the Samsonite replacement	4
that the vendor sent	4
me was great	4
and it worked really well on my trip.	4
Quality was the factor	7
and the zippers on the Case Logic were substandard,	7
so be careful	4
when considering their product.	4

B0038KLD50-0011
The case looks lovely,	3
and has lots of nice pockets.	0
But, the first case	4
that I rec	4
'd had a defective zipper.	7
No problem getting it returned	1
and replaced.	1
The replacement case appeared fine -	4
until I used it for travel the first time.	4
The pad	4
that slips over the straps	4
to provide comfort	4
when carrying the case	4
started coming apart,	7
and when the fraying stops,	4
the pad will fall off.	7
An additional note on the padded shoulder strap : The buckle on the ` adjustable shoulder strap ' does not actually fit through that shoulder pad,	2
so the strap can never be adjusted to anything other than short or shorter length	2
if you want to use that padding.	2
If you actually want it to go over-the-shoulder	4
and across your body like a true messenger,	4
you can't adjust the strap	2
to be long enough	2
(unless you don't want that pad to be on your shoulder - ouch).	4
This was true of both cases,	4
so it is simply bad design.	4

B0038KLD50-0012
I was happy with this bag early on.. seemingly well padded, lots of space and pockets, and an attractive design for a reasonable price.	5 8 0 3
However, after less than 2 weeks of use, the strap	2 7
detached from one side as I	2 7
was walking down the sidewalk.	4
The bag swung down	4
and hit the pavement on one corner,	4
denting in the corner of my laptop.	6
Now, I did have a laptop, battery, and a few notebooks/books in the bag,	4
but I didn't feel	4
that it was significantly overloaded or heavy.	4
Upon closer examination, it appeared	4
that the sewing/seam	7
attaching the strap to the bag	7
is minimal, and probably not very durable	7
(the strap on the other side was also halfway torn out).	4
I was also disappointed	6
the padding underneath was not very effective in protecting my laptop.	6
Overall, its a pretty nice-looking bag, but the seams	3
where the strap attaches to the bag are one pretty significant flaw... just not a durable design.	7
If you do decide to purchase this bag,	4
be sure to keep	4
it loaded very lightly.	4

B0038KLD50-0014
The bag is nice	4
and seems well made.	7
My only complaint is	4
that the shoulder strap is not on a metal swivel.	2
Sooner or later the plastic connector or the strap is going to break from wear.	2 7

B0038KLD50-0019
I just bought an Acer Aspire TimelineX 13 '',	4
and the laptop fits perfect there.	8
The case design is the most comfortable	8
that I've had.	4
It's compact, padded everywhere and with a lot of compartments.	6 8 0
The mesh pocket is very useful for the laptop's large power brick.	0
The only downside is that before 2 weeks of very mild use	7
(and only used it to transport the laptop one time from NY to Boston and back)	4
and one of the corners already got ripped.	7
Looks like	7
they're not very durable.	7
I 'm	4
including a pic.	4

B0038KLD50-0024
I'm pretty pleased with this messenger bag.	4
It has loads of space	8
since I only own a 10 '' netbook.	4
I'm not sure how well this would accommodate a larger laptop,	8
but for my purposes, I've got lots of room	8
to spare for other goodies	8
and that's the biggest reason	4
I like it.	4
As far as internal padding, it's a bit weak for my taste.	6
I place my netbook inside a padded sleeve	4
before placing it into this bag.	4
I like a little more protection for my computer	6
than what is in this bag.	6
If I didn't already have a padded sleeve,	4
I'd probably be disappointed with this bag.	4
I'm also not sure how durable this material is.	7
I've been using this bag daily for well over a month now and thus far,	7
it has held up quite well,	7
but something tells	4
me this is a 1-3 year use bag and not a 5-10 year bag,	7
but then again, it all depends on your usage of it	4
and whether or not you're very hard on it.	4
For my purposes and use of the bag, I am pleased.	4
I'm using it every day.	4

This laptop case from Case Logic is nice for a non-fancy leathery kind.	4
It is a 13-14 inch case, sadly a little too small for my Toshiba.	8
My Dell would be fine in it, though.	8
It has sufficient pockets and nice padding for the laptop compartment.	6 0
It is black and gray with lime green.	3
The handle is adjustable	2
and I think	4
it would do well in the rain,	4
as it seems	4
the rain would roll right off of it.	4
Overall, a nice well-made product for its level.	7

B0038KLD50-0045
This is really nice case.	4
You can access the laptop	4
without needing to open the flap	0
and the laptop comes out easily.	4
I've had this for about 6 months	7
it has no signs of wear.	7
It is very durable.	7
It also has a large amount of padding, probably about 1/2 ''.	6
The flap has three pockets ; one on the outside and two on the inside.	0
I have no problems	0
fitting a mouse, mouse pad, charger, and headset inside it.	0
However, it is too small	8
to fit a keyboard.	8
One review complains about the flap	4
being held in place with magnets.	4
This is not true.	4
Mine is attached with velcro.	4

B0038KLD50-0047
The messenger bag has a place for every thing	0
and for the price it is a great value.	5
I hope the handles wear well	2 7
but I would feel this about any product	4
made of the same material.	7
The bag closes up very nice and is not baggie or sloppy looking,	3
it has good form,	3
that's important to me.	4
The function of the bag and its clean lines are well thought out.	3
Over all a really good purchases.	4

B003BWYJ4C-0000
i swapped my mac for a smaller dell laptop xps,	4
so i needed a smaller case/sleeve. the design on the site looked cute. however,	3
it turned out about the same size	8
as my higher end marc jacobs sleeve	8
(which i love,	4
but didn't need all the space)	8
and the quality of this case is terrible,	7
like made in china,	7
bought in chinatown terrible. i	7
suppose you get what you pay for : (	5

B003BWYJ4C-0001
It was very small and tight.	8
I really did not like it.	4
The pink flowers look really fake and cheap.	3
I have a case on my 13 inch macbook and its very hard	8
to close it.	8

B003BWYJ4C-0004
It's pretty in the picture,	3
but I don't care for it much in person.	3
It's poor quality	7
and I don't trust my laptop	6
to be protected in it.	6
A few months after I bought this	4
I found an amazing brand name laptop case for half this price.	4
Too bad it's too late	4
to return this one,	4
but I guess	4
I'll just keep it in my closet.	4

B003BWYJ4C-0005
When I got this case I got it	4
because it said	8
it would fit a 13-14 inch Notebook Laptop Computer.	8
I have a 14 inch	8
and it does not fit.	8
I can not zip it shut.	8
Otherwise the sleeve looks nice, is pretty	3
and seems to be in good condition	3
but I gave it 2 stars	4
because I was misled	4
into purchasing this item	4
and it doesn't even fit my laptop.	8

B003BWYJ4C-0006
It's really good looking	3
and I feel	6
like it protects my laptop well	6
but sometimes the zipper gets stuck.	7
I have really push my macbook in.	8
I have a speck hard cover on my laptop,	4
which may be the reason why,	4
but I saw some other reviews with the same issue.	4
It does fit with a case on it though, you just have to make sure	8
it's really in there.	8

B003BWYJ4C-0007
When I received the carrying case I thought	4
it was very cute.	3
It looks exactly	3
as it appears in the picture.	3
If you like bright pink then you	3
'll love this!	3
It sorta looks like a sticker with japanese design to it.	3
I have to get use to the bright pink...	3
it looks like it cheapens the look in a way.	3
But I did receive some compliments about the bag -	4
the japanese design is an eye catcher with the bright pink.	3
I purchased the package deal	5
($ 67	5
which is a good deal	5
compared to the one item for $ 50	5
you get from the apple store)	5
...	4
the carrying side bag, case sleeve, pink rubber keyboard cover	3
(which I love!	3
It's a purple pink not too bright).	3

B003BWYJ4C-0013
If all you need to do	4
is protect your MacBook,	6
this stylish bag is well-constructed and just the thing.	6 7 3
Wish it had an outer pocket	0
to carry the power cord.	0

B003BWYJ4C-0016
We have a Macbook Air and a Pro, both 13 '',	4
and we bought two of this sleeve.	4
Fits very well, especially for the Pro, looks pretty, and very light weight.	8 3
One zipper isn't as smooth	7
when it meets the corner,	7
but that's not a problem	4
if handled with care.	4

B003BWYJ4C-0020
I purchased this case for my wife for her new MBAir	4
and she loves it!	4
The case arrived promptly,	1
it is the correct size,	8
and works	4
as advertised.	4
As I have never purchased a laptop case before,	4
I was a bit surprised	4
how thin it was.	3
It doesn't add much bulk to the super-thin MBAir	8
and yet provides enough protection during normal use.	6
It fits very nicely in my wife's purse	8
and looks great!	3

B003BWYJ4C-0030
I love my pink floral carrying case for my Mac book.	3
It fits perfectly	8
and provides padding for travel.	6
It's also stylish,	3
and matches my pink plastic cover for the laptop.	3
It fits nicely into a backpack	8
without a lot of bulk.	8

B0064RDIWU-0003
The color was great --	3
as expected,	4
the fit was not.	8
The case did not line up with the ports	8
and it did not clip into place --	8
not even with persuasion!	8
I would not recommend this product.	4

B0064RDIWU-0008
This case is awful.	4
The bottom has no way	7
of staying on.	7
Its ridiculous...	4
The styrofoam feet are going to fall off instantly.	7
The material	7
it is made of seems	7
like it would make a good case,	7
but I really don't understand	4
why there is no way the make	8
the bottom part " snap " on.	8
Extremely disappointed...	4

B0064RDIWU-0017
I like the case overall and I really like the color,	3
but what made me only give it 2 stars was the rubber bottoms.	7 3
They were a cheap white material	7
and got messy.	7
I tried	4
pulling them off	4
to put my own on at it was kind of hard to do.	4

B0064RDIWU-0023
This case looks and feels great,	3
but is not too good for protection.	6
My laptop usually just sits on my desk,	4
which is great for this case, but the first time	4
I decided to take my laptop with me,	4
and placed it in a sleeve inside my backpack,	4
the case	7
developed cracks all over	7
and part of it chipped off.	7
But at 1/4 the price of the Speck cases	5
that I also have,	4
I guess	5
you get	5
what you pay for.	5
Update :	4
after less than six months, all of the rubber feet fell off	7
and the bottom piece cracked to the point	7
that it no longer would stay on.	7
Went back to a Speck case about a month ago	4
and couldn't be happier.	4

B0064RDIWU-0028
Color is awesome!	3
Top cover fit perfect.	8
Bottom was a great fit on the back	8
but failed to latch on at the front.	8
The keyboard cover was great but after having it a few months	4
the cover is not sealing anymore.	8
The corners on the top and bottom are beginning to crack.	7
The computer does not move all that much	4
so I can't think of a reason	7
why it would begin to crack.	7

B0064RDIWU-0029
It's a nice color	3
and has effectively protected my macbook.	6
However, I've been	4
trying to remove it to clean my computer	8
and it's really difficult for it to come off.	8
I was only able to remove the bottom.	8
Heads up!	4

B0064RDIWU-0041
Being paranoid about scratching or spilling something on my computer,	4
I decided to buy a hard case.	4
I love the color	3
and it was really easy to put on.	8
The only concern	4
that I really had was	4
that since I now had the case on my computer would still fit into the sleeve	4
that I had	4
bought to carry it around in,	4
and yes it still does	4
even though it is a little snug.	4
The only reason	4
why it didn't get five stars	4
is	4
because the case came with a couple of scratches,	7
but that was not a problem for me.	4

B0064RDIWU-0052
This case is a gorgeous, bright green color.	3
It's not the most well made, and the last time	7
I bought it	7
it developed a few cracks after a month or two of use.	7
There were a couple sharp areas of plastic	7
I had to file down.	7
However, I bought the case again	4
when my old one wore out	7
(about 7 months after I bought it)	7
because it's cheap	5
and does	5
what I want it to for the price.	5
Plus, a lot of the more expensive cases aren't as bright as this one.	3

B0064RDIWU-0085
So, I was very skeptical about a case in general.	4
I wanted lime green,	3
and this is actually lime green...	3
It feels nice and rubbery	7 3
(not yucky plastic like	4
some covers).	4
Not recommended for greasy fingers,	4
but I do	4
it anyways	4
and there aren't that many marks.	4
It's a perfect fit	8
(I'm just bad at taking off the top ;	8
though I have taken it off multiple times.)	8
You can see the apple logo,	4
and it doesn't scratch your computer. it doesn't add too much bulk,	8 3
but it's definitely adds a little more weight	4

B0064RDIWU-0086
I am fussy about everything.	4
I love this cover.	4
It clips on easily,	8
the color is gorgeous Tiffany blue/green,	3
it has a nice satin outer and hard inner side.	3
The apple lite shows through	3
if that is a concern for you.	4
I got this from TopCase in record time.	1
It arrived two days	1
after I ordered it	1
and was in excellent condition.	1

B0083LOW7A-0000
Poor quality.	7
The " quilted	7 3
" pattern had large creases and wrinkles.	7 3
The handles felt cheap	2
and the white part on the bottom had black marks on it.	7 3
Then there was the overpowering chemical smell	7
that was nauseating.	7
It was a mix of chemical and mothballs.	7
I would have returned this bag	4
simply because of the smell	4
but the fact	4
it was in poor condition	7
was really annoying.	7
I would not recommend this bag.	4

B0083LOW7A-0003
This bag might look nice,	3
but it is of terrible quality.	7
The strap broke after only 3 months,	2 7
and even though they kindly replaced it for me, less than 2 months later the new strap couldn't even click onto the bag	2 7
because the black piece	2 7
that holds the hook completely	2 7
ripped off.	2 7
After emailing them several times,	1
they still wouldn't refund me	1
because they claimed	1
that their warranty lasts only 1 month.	1
Who wants a laptop case	4
that's only guaranteed to last one month?	4
This case is such a waste of money,	5
it would be much more worth	4
it to spend a little more	4
to get a case	4
that lasts.	4

B0083LOW7A-0006
My handle has already started to rip.	2 7
It looks similar to a lap top bag not a purse	3
like I was hoping.	4
Has good protection on the inside for the lap top	6
I just thought	4
there would be more pockets as well as not looking so cheap.	3 0
Definitely would not pay more than ten bucks for this if that.	5

B0083LOW7A-0007
Very fast shipping.	1
Materials are cheap, stitches along the borders are not very secure. barely fit a 14 inch hp sleek notebook.	8 7
Does not worth 25 $.	5
Rather spend 5 more dollars	4
and get a better quality bag than this trash.	7
It doesnt even look as sophisticate	3
as shown in picture ;	3
it look like my 2 years old sister's bag.	3

B0083LOW7A-0008
Looks very good, very professional, fashionable.	3
Material is way to cheap	7
and it won't last to much.	7
I already have a lot of problems with it.	4
Inside is awesome for your laptop.	8
I won't recommend it if you will use it everyday or for traveling.	4

B0083LOW7A-0011
This bag does not fit my laptop.	8
The pocket inside for the laptop would fit a tablet best.	8
I have a 15 inch screen	4
and it's the only thing	4
I can fit in the bag.	4
The bag is lovely and true to the pic,	3
but make sure	4
you know your computer size first	8
before you get caught up in how cute the bag looks	3
like I did LOL	4

B0083LOW7A-0020
I recently purchased my first mac for college	4
and I was so excited to get a new bag	4
to hold it.	4
When I saw this bag	4
I knew	4
it would be perfect	4
and it is!	4
It has two pockets, one for the laptop itself and then one for other things such as folders or a planner.	0
I used this bag for classes	4
and attached the shoulder strap.	2
But after about a month of use the loops	2 7
that I hooked the shoulder strap to	2 7
started to tear.	2 7
I unfortunately had to stop using it as a class bag	4
but it still works great	4
if I am going out to study	4
and I just need to bring my laptop and a notebook.	4
The hand straps have not ripped or torn so	2
really I think	4
the problem was	4
that I put too much weight in the bag.	4
I still use it quite often and I would highly recommend this item.	4
It is wonderful.	4
It looks great	3
and overall it functions perfectly!	4

B0083LOW7A-0021
I purchased this for work,	4
as my other one didnt allow much room	4
to keep paper work or folders in it with the laptop.	4
However, I wish	4
they had an outer extended compartment for my power plug.	0
With the laptop, and a few folders, the bag looks and closes nice.	8 3
If i try to put the power cord in as well,	8
the bag looks bulky and doesnt close right.	8
For now i have the power cord in the little red bag	4
that comes with it,	4
but I carry it seperate.	4
Id recommend this to anyone	4
who doesnt plan	4
on carrying much else than their laptop, some pens and a notebook,	8
which the cord will fit in the other side no problem.	8
This would be more of a personal laptop bag	4

B0083LOW7A-0071
Love the bag, protects my lap top perfectly!	6
The color ir so pretty,	3
matches my laptop's pink case, pink speakers and pink keyboard cover < 3	3
also my pink kindle case :D wich	8 3
this bag is big enough to carry it as well.	8
It is very well built,	7
the material has good quality	7
and the little bag for the laptop cables is big enough	8 0
to keep safe my macbook cables, some adapters, remote control and the pink strap	8 2 0
that comes with this bag.	2
Also it has cellphone and pens compartments	0
and it has as much space	0
to save documents, kindle in case, glasses case, the little white bag, my speakers, some CDs and my wallet,	0
without deforming or looking stuffed.	0
I definitely recommend this bag!!!	4

B0083LOW7A-0081
The price was good,	5
and it fits my 14 inch Toshiba perfectly.	8
It looks good	3
and holds the cords, my mouse and a mouse pad.	8 0
It is lightweight.	7
It does come with a shoulder strap.	2
I picked this bag	4
because it had cushioning on the inside for extra protection.	6
The only thing	0
I would have liked	0
is an outside pocket.	0
But that is minor.	4
Love the color.	3

B0085B772A-0001
I bought this case	4
based on the good reviews and the cheap price.	5
My wife and I have to 13. 3 ' macbooks and I had the $ 40 incase sleeve	4
and I got a $ 25 case logic case for my wife.	4
Both of those were made out of noticeably thicker material than this one.	7
While this case fit fine	8
and looked fine,	3
I could tell right away	4
that the material was thinner, almost paper-thin.	7
I just would feel nervous putting my laptop in one of these,	4
you might as well not have a case at all.	4
I returned it	4
and opted for the $ 25 case logic case.	4
I think	4
it's worth the extra $ 10.	5

B0085B772A-0002
I bought this case with the intent	4
that it would protect my computer.	6
It did the complete opposite,	6
and now the paint on the front part of my computer has worn off in two spots.	4
The front zipper	4
where the charger is placed	4
(as pictured in the photo),	4
wore a hole through the padding,	7
and started to scratch my computer.	7
Avoid this case.	4

B0085B772A-0009
Description says	4
it will fit 13. 3 inch ultrabooks,	8
but this is false.	8
Do not buy for a 13. 3 inch ultrabook.	4
My Lenovo Ideapad Yoga 13 did not fit in it.	8
Good product design,	3
but poor description.	4

B0085B772A-0010
The good :	4
Thin but well padded, inexpensive,	5 7
and good	3
looking sleeve.	3
I loved it	4
when I first opened it.	4
My Lenovo Yoga 2 Pro was slightly loose, but still secure in it.	6 8
I chose this sleeve over the other for the possibility	4
of sticking the power cord into the side pocket in a rush situation.	0
The bad and the ugly.	4
As soon as I put my laptop in the sleeve, I noticed	4
that the sleeve has hidden on the inside two loops	4
that can be pulled out	4
and used	4
to carry the the case with your hands.	4
Neat idea, except that those two loops are attached to the inside of the case with two thick metallic buttons.	4
And guess what,	4
as you slide your laptop in and out of the sleeve,	4
they rub against the exterior of the laptop regularly,	6
making it ripe for scratches and marks.	6
Just what I needed for my delicate ultrabook.	4
Thankfully Amazon has easy returns and this one is going back for sure!	4

B0085B772A-0011
I have a new 13 ''	4
Macbook Air	4
and was looking for a horizontally-oriented sleeve	4
to put in another bag.	4
The price on this was good	5
and the feel is generally OK,	7
but I have a couple of complaints.	4
First, the sleeve is a bit too big for the Macbook Air.	8
There's still a lot of empty space	8
when the computer is in the sleeve.	4
Second, the sleeve isn't really that protective.	6
The material is quite thin.	7
I wouldn't count on any sort of drop protection	6
if you happen to drop your computer	6
while it's in this sleeve.	6
Overall, can't complain too much	4
but I'm on the lookout for other sleeves.	4

B0085B772A-0012
The sleeve gives a good protection	6
and looks rugged enough	7
to be used in backpacks or suitcases.	4
It's light padded	4
but I didn't expect a huge protection from shocks or hits by this kind of sleeves.	6
The downside	4
(that costed two stars to this review)	4
is	4
that there are two small handles with metallic fastener	2
that are normally	2
stowed inside the sleeve.	2
The fasteners are in direct contact with the laptop	2
so they might end up	4
scratching it.	4

B0085B772A-0040
Bought this item for the Lenovo	4
(13 '') Yoga laptop.	4
Although you have to stretch the sleeve a bit around the edge of the laptop	8
to zip it close,	8
the product is everything	4
I expected.	4
The side pocket adds a nice touch.	0
Cushioning/padding is adequate.	6 7
Overall, great product for a reasonable price.	5

B0085B772A-0042
Not much to say about this,	4
it's a fairly basic neoprene sleeve.	4
It has nice construction for $ 12.	5 7
Steel zipper glides are kept away from scratching your laptop by internal gussets of neoprene.	6
The external pocket is fairly big.	0
Mine is black on the outside and lime green inside, an attractive combination.	3
The sleeve is slightly too big for a new 13 " Macbook Pro.	8
While it's not exactly a " custom fit ",	8
it works fine.	8
No reason to spend any more than this.	5

B0085B772A-0057
This bag is very well-made.	7
When I ordered it,	4
I didn't realize	4
that it even has handles hidden at the top!	2
It's a little bit	8
bigger than my 13. 3 inch Macbook Pro	8
(even after I put on a hard shell)	4
;	4
so if you are looking for a snug fit,	8
this might not be your favorite.	8
But it works for me.	4
I especially like the front pocket.	0
It would be so convenient for the charger and everything else	0
(e.g., a mouse).	4

B0085B772A-0080
This is a nice neoprene sleeve for my MacBook Air.	4
The fit is perfect	8
and it gives a nice amount of padding.	6
It probably won't protect my laptop from a fall,	6
but it's great for day-to-day protection	6
while my laptop is either at my home or tucked inside my briefcase.	4
My only complaint is the interior color -	3
the black case has a BRIGHT lime green interior.	3
I don't care for it,	4
but no one really sees it.	4
Overall, a good value.	5

B009PJ2CQC-0001
I loved this case,	4
it was so inexpensive	5
and my macbook air fit perfectly in it.	8
Unfortunately after regular use, i.e.	4
I used	4
it Monday-Thursday in Law School,	4
it already has ripped at an edge.	7
I am so careful with my laptop	4
so I'm assuming	4
this is from poor quality of the case.	7
But you do get	4
what you pay for.	4
I guess	4
I just thought	4
it would last me at least a semester not just 1 month!	4

B009PJ2CQC-0004
This might be a good case for other 13. 3 inch laptop,	4
but it definitely does	8
not fit a Macbook Air 13. 3	8
(2013 model).	4
The case is so small	8
that it's difficult for me to put Macbook Air into it	8
and I could hardly take it out of the case.	8

B009PJ2CQC-0005
I know	4
this wasn't an overly expensive item,	5
but at the same time, it should work for what it is advertised.	4
I purchased this case for a 13 in macbook air,	8
and it doesn't even begin to fit.	8
I can not get the laptop even half way into this case.	8
I read many reviews prior to actually ordering	4
that indicated quite clearly	4
they had also used it for a 13 in macbook air.	4
I would be perfectly content if only it actually covered the item	4
for which it was purchased.	4
I does appear	4
as though it would fulfill my needs for a lightweight cover	4
to allow me to easily store my laptop around the house	4
without worrying about the stray scratches and scuffs.	4
IF ONLY IT WOULD FIT!!	8

B009PJ2CQC-0013
I ordered this sleeve for my Lenovo Ideapad.	4
The case was TOO SMALL.	8
The computer fit,	8
but just barely.	8
It's a hassle getting it in or out of the sleeve,	8
and the seams began to tear within a week of receiving it.	7
It's not leather,	7
and it doesn't look like it.	7
I do like the soft material inside,	7
and the magnetic closure is slick.	4
Although it pops open regularly,	4
because the case is too small for the computer	8
it is advertised	8
to fit in the title.	8

B009PJ2CQC-0016
An awesome lil stylish bag	3
that fits a Macbook Air or any other	8
that's slightly slightly thicker	8
will fit perfectly.	8
It looked better in the picture,	3
but it was still good.	3
I bought	4
as a gift and my friend was really pleased	4
so it worked out.	4

B009PJ2CQC-0018
I got this as a gift,	4
and I have the Lenovo IdeaPad U310,	4
which it says	4
is compatible.	4
IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE.	4
The laptop doesn't fit inside,	8
it's too big by about 1/2in to even fit in the opening,	8
not to mention having	4
to fit the entire height of the computer inside.	8
I'm going to have to buy one size bigger	8
if it's available.	4
It is a very nice-looking case	3
and I hope	4
one size bigger is available.	8

B009PJ2CQC-0021
This case is really beautiful	3
and fits my computer snug.	8
Fashionable and sleek I am pretty happy with it.	3
The quality isn't the best	7
and I have a little tear in from commuting so much with it,	7
but nothing that will stop me from using it.	4
Great product for the price.	5

B009PJ2CQC-0026
Great!	4
Good price, quick ship, fits a regular 13 '' best.	5 8
My MacBook Pro fits very tightly inside this sleeve so expect that	8
to be a minor problem.	4
Only one I can think of though.	4
Very nice leather and quality product	7
that is definitely worth the money.	5
Looks good and is easy to handle	3
without slipping out of your hands.	4
Also great protection with average use.	6
Recommended.	4

I purchased this to keep dust and scratches away from my new Sony Vaio Pro 13 ultrabook.	4
It fits beautifully	8
and looks great.	3
Product quality is also good.	7
No issues with closure on the Vaio,	4
regardless of direction of insertion, though it is easier	4
to pull it out	4
if you put the spine in first.	4
Recommend the vendor and the product.	4

Right size.	8
Good quality.	7
Great price.	5
Don't look further.	4
The Dell notebook is odd shape and leather sleeve	4
(US$ 60),	4
or the nylon one	4
(US$ 30)	4
offered by Dell are not superior to this one.	4
