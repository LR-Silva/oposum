B000BNRWFW-0000
Advertised as leather,	4
but is in fact a cloth backed synthetic!	4
Maybe it's a DM knock off.	5
It is a cheap, but not inexpensive boot.	6
I returned my pair due to the misleading representation.	5
I never put	5
them on and only listed " fit as expected "	1
because it was obligatory to write the review.	5
Beware!	5

B000BNRWFW-0001
Yes they have a steal toe	4
but they have a tag on them	5
that reads `` IMPORTANT WARNINGTheae shoes	5
(boots) have	5
been designed and manufactured as, and, for use as FASHION FOOTWEAR ONLY.	4
They are not for use as safety footwear,	4
and should not under any circumstances be worn as safety footwear... `` A warning is also stitched into the inside of the boot near the heal	4
that reads `` NON-SAFTY FOOTEAR `` I am a little	5
let down that this fact is not listed in the products description.	5
The reason I purchased these boots for work	5
and they do not meet the required safety standard.	5

B000BNRWFW-0003
These things	5
while they look the same, are not.	5
The leather is a less finished product, a cheaper leather	4
that is not soft at all.	4
All in all, not near	5
what they were back	5
when they were made in England.	5
Made in China... sums it up.	5

B000BNRWFW-0005
I got	5
black ankle high boots like I wore back in the 90 's..	5
These don't come close to the quality	4
they had	5
when they were made in UK..	5
Just like everything else, cheaply made shoe from China.	5
Leather is very thin & sole	4
is super soft unlike the way they were made.	4
They are okay boots but very sad to see quality going into the crapper along with everything	5
now made in China..	5
I'd pay $ 200. 00 for quality boots vs. $ 125. 00 for junk..	6

B000BNRWFW-0007
The other reviews were right	5
-- Docs are not as comfortable	1
as they were back	1
when I wore them in high school.	5
The leather looks cheaper,	4
and it's taking longer	1
to break them in.	1

B000BNRWFW-0008
so I order this shoe is such high hopes,	5
shipping was fast so thats a plus.	5
Now my issue	4
with this boots were	4
that they came	4
without any type of cushioning???	4
I didn't cared much but	5
after I tried them on i	5
heard a horrible squeak	5
coming out of them.	5
I concluded	5
that the tongue was the issue. anyways	4
i returned them for a pair of DR Martens Saltaire	5
ST boots.	5
This was 2 years ago so	5
hopefully this classic boots changed that.	5

B000BNRWFW-0010
They look great, seem to be well made, however,	3 2
is a little tight across the top of foot	1
where the tongue is sewn to the top of boot.	1
It is painful at the moment,	1
but will power through in hopes	5
of breaking them in and thus be able to enjoy for a long time.	1 2

B000BNRWFW-0013
I purchased the black steel toe boots.	5
When they arrived,	5
the little piece inside the shoe	5
that goes at the heel	5
had fallen off.	2
There was some dried glue	4
where it was supposed to have been.	5
I just stuck it back but seriously?	5
I was sort of disappointed	5
but other than	5
that the boots were in good condition.	5
They are comfortable	1
after breaking them in!	1

B000BNRWFW-0015
These steel toe boots are great.	5
Need them for work.	5
They are very comfortable	1
and provide the protection	2
I need.	5
Will buy same thing	5
again when and if these wear out.	2

B000BNRWFW-0019
Got these bad boys for Christmas.	5
Took awhile to break them in	5
but am so glad	5
I did.	5
Very comfortable,	1
and I also feel tough with the steel toe.	5
Good for the snow too.	8
Would recommend for anyone	5
who wants traditional and sturdy Dr. Martens.	2

B000GAUOHS-0001
I had such high hopes for these boots	5
after reading all the great reviews.	5
I am an average sized gal	5
and have never had a problem	5
zipping up boots,	5
but these were way too narrow in the foot and the shaft.	1
I wear a size 8 or 8. 5 normally.	7
I ordered the 8	7
and couldn't zip them up even half way,	7
plus the actual foot part was too narrow.	1
I don't think going up half a size	7
would have fixed the narrow width or the the narrow shaft,	5
so I just returned them for a refund.	5

B000GAUOHS-0002
I guess	5
I thought the name " lasticity " and the description of the stretch of this boot,	5
led me to believe	5
that it would fit a wider calf.	1
I could not even zip this boot up	1
and it did not have much stretch to it at all!	1
I have about a 17 " calf so for those of you	5
ladies with larger calf sizes...	5
this boot is not for you!	5
It also appears to be a taller boot,	3
but I would say	3
it is barely mid-calf.	3
Otherwise, it is a nice looking boot for the price.	6 3
Disappointed!	5

B000GAUOHS-0005
I was really hoping	5
these boots would be cute,	3
based on some other reviewers.	5
But	5
when I got them	5
and tried them on,	5
I was surprised	5
that they were loose around my calves -	1
usually boots are tight on me in that area.	5
Not only that, but the ankle area was really flimsy,	5
and collapsed in an unattractive way.	3
Had to return them.	5

B000GAUOHS-0007
I learned the hard way	5
that the brand name " Aerosoles " does not always mean comfort.	1
I loved the style	3
and tried to use shoe stretch spray	5
and wear multiple socks	5
to loosen the grip of the shoe around the width of my feet for a week or so to no avail.	1
Also, the sole of the boot was very rigid and unforgiving to the the arches of my feet, thus major uncomfort	1 4
pursued my body.	1

B000GAUOHS-0013
I ordered these boots	5
and immediately sent them back.	5
Too big and baggy on my skinny calves.	7
Ironically enough I bought	5
these boots cause	5
I found a website	5
that specifically recommended them for `` skinny calves ''.	5
I wore them around the house for a while.	5
They seems comfy	1
but were clearly very cheaply made.	2
My quest for skinny calf boots continues...	5
bummer.	5

B000GAUOHS-0019
These boots have a sturdy, comfortable sole with a heel	1
that is easy to walk on	1
and ample toe room,	7
but beyond that, I am disappointed.	5
The material is very thin and flimsy	4
(don't expect the shaft	5
to hold up	5
like it does in the picture	5
-- it sagged and wrinkled on my thin calves,	5
leaving a huge gap between the shaft and my leg).	5
In short,	5
if you 're	5
looking for comfort, affordability,	6 1
and have the calves	5
to fill these out,	5
they are a reasonably attractive boot.	3
But don't expect anything beyond that.	5
Given the thin quality of the material,	4
I doubt	2
these boots would last long.	2

B000GAUOHS-0033
These are very comfortable & attractive boots for my office environment.	1 3
I bought them before a trip to Chicago & found them to be very dry,	8
but that they would not protect my feet from the cold enough for long walks.	8
The aerosoles sole is just like on their shoes -	4
which is fairly thin.	4
The uppers fit my calf well	5
(in recent years	5
most boot uppers have been too wide for my leg).	5
I only wish	4
that they were leather.	4
Another positive was the lack of break-in time.	1
Wore them 10 hours on the first day.	5

B000GAUOHS-0041
I really love the boots mainly	5
because the bottom of the boots have traction for bad weather	8
which is one of the things	5
I was looking for.	5
They also fit my small calves,	1
I have a little room	5
but that is okay.	5
And they have a little shine	3
that is natural	3
and I like that.	5
They are really comfortable	1
and I can wear them to work and not have to take them off all day.	1
I have worn them a lot since I purchased them because of the weather here in D.C.	8
(cold/snow/wet).	8
They are one of my best purchases.	5
Thank you.	5

B000GAUOHS-0071
I really love these boots.	5
They fit perfectly	1
and they are VERY comfortable.	1
I can wear them all day at work	1
and my feet do not hurt at all.	1
I am so glad	5
that I found these!	5

B000GAUOHS-0076
I bought these boots	5
to wear to my job as a high school teacher.	5
I read many reviews	5
touting the comfort of these boots	1
and they were not lying.	1
I have worn them all day -	1
I mean from 7 AM until 9PM -	5
and my feet do not hurt at all.	1
The soles are not hard either,	4
which helps in the Maine winter.	8
They do not slide easily as many soles tend to do on snow.	8
I would buy these boots again.	5
They fit snuggly around the heel and leg,	1
but not too much so.	1
Just enough to stay up,	5
I think.	5
Some reviews indicated	5
they were a bit tight ;	5
however, I have no issues.	5
I am not overweight,	5
but have athletic calves.	5
They fit me fine.	1
Great boots for the money!	6

B000ZHDMFS-0000
This shoe hurts.	1
As soon as I put it on, I knew	5
it was a mistake	5
to buy them.	5
Where the seams are sewn along all those straps	5
crisscrossing the toes	5
it is quite irritating.	5
I knew	5
I would have blisters within minutes	1
of walking around in them.	1
I tried to take precautions	5
by applying band-aids	5
before I went for a walk,	5
but they were still causing me pain.	1

B000ZHDMFS-0002
They look great,	3
but are very uncomfortable.	1
While generally bigger overall,	5
the area around the ball of the foot is not comfortable.	1
Also, there are pieces	5
inside that are very scratchy and make them not wearable.	1

B000ZHDMFS-0003
I love the design, the material, and the color.	0 4 3
BUT for that price I was expecting SUPER COMFY summer shoes.	1
This is not the case,	5
the inside lining is awful and hurt my feet,	1 4
If I could return them I would.	5
I wore them just once : (	5

B000ZHDMFS-0004
I have several pairs of Jambu shoes	5
and love them.	5
I've always worn my normal size	7
(7).	5
I think	5
the low sides in this shoe is what make it too big.	7
It is way too sloppy for my foot.	1 7
Also the red is not a bright red, but more of a rust.	0
Could be a cute shoe,	3
but not for me.	5
Exchanging for a different style.	5

B000ZHDMFS-0007
I saw these in a magazine	5
and thought	5
they would be great for a cruise	5
we are	5
taking this summer.	5
I have kind of narrow feet	5
and the shoe is a little tight, width wise.	7
I like the sole	4
and they are comfortable to wear around the house but not for actually walking.	1
They are pretty heavy too.	5
I have a blister after a quick two mile walk	1
(with socks)	5
but am going to continue to try and break them in.	5
I like the toe lift	5
(less tripping)	5
and they should be cooler than my Nikes.	5
They aren't as cute on my size 10 foot as the picture.	3
They used more calf muscle than my other shoes	5
if that matters to anyone.	5

B000ZHDMFS-0010
Very cute shoes, though they seem to run a bit wide.	3 7
I don't know	5
if they need	5
broken in	5
or what but they gave me a blister on my heel and the start of a blister above my big toe...	1
and I only had them on for an hour just to run to the store	5
and come home.	5
They seem to be well made they just fit kinda funny.	1 2

B000ZHDMFS-0011
I really love the design of this shoe and the 360 degrees venting concept.	3
Definitely agree	5
that you need to order a half size down maybe even a full size.	7
If your foot is narrow,	1 7
I don't recommend this shoe	1
as it fits quite wide.	1
I may have to return it because of that.	5
Very cute shoe though!	3

B000ZHDMFS-0012
I really like this shoe.	5
It is to wide for my feet,	5
but because their a mary jane I can still make them work.	5
I wore them	5
the other dayand	5
they were very comfortable.	1

B000ZHDMFS-0018
I finally found the shoe	5
that has toe coverage, yet airy, comfortable and cute.	1 3
I saw these shoes on a ad in the travel magazine	5
and I purchased the same color.	0
The foot bed has memory foam,	4
and there is no break in time necessary.	1
Love these shoes.	5

B000ZHDMFS-0024
saw these advertised in a magazine.	5
Was looking for a good comfortable pair of walking shoes.	1
These are perfect.	5
Fit as expected, true to size and extremely comfortable.	1 7
Nice looking shoes.	3

B001RIYTK6-0001
Great fit, however my socks were soaked the first time	8 1
I wore them out in the rain.	8
I was really upset	5
because they were suppose to keep my feet dry!	8
I returned them as a defective item back to Amazon.	8

B001RIYTK6-0003
These boots look good and fit great,	1 3
they have a nice thick sole with good tread.	4
I thought	5
I had finally found the perfect pair of boots.	5
Then the second time	8
I wore them both feet	8
leaked.	8
What's the point of rainboots	8
that don't keep your feet dry??	8
BIG waste of money.	6
Next time I'm going to LL Bean.	5

B001RIYTK6-0005
These run small	7
and	5
if you have bigger calves	7
they won't fit	7
(you can't tuck your pants in).	7
They were a little thinner in material than the true barn boots	4 2
I am use to,	4 2
so don't buy	2
if you will be needing to use for heavy work.	2

B001RIYTK6-0006
So, I bought these shoes	5
and they were fine.	5
Hardly wore them,	5
but it's been two years	5
and I had to go back to my reliable LL Beane duck boots	5
because these Chooka's split	2
after sitting in a humidified room for two years.	8 2
Buyer beware.	5
I buy my shoes to last.	5

B001RIYTK6-0007
Definitely order a size bigger than your foot	7
as I followed the advice on the other buyers here.	7
It has pretty good traction for a rainy day	8
and interestingly enough I didn't slip that much on ice with these things on.	8
HOWEVER, these aren't worth the price for these shoes.	6
After maybe two months the rubber actually starting	2
tearing at the side of the soles from the constant folding the rubber had gone through in my numerous walks.	2
Also, the buckles at the top are pretty much there for decoration	4 2
and sometimes would come out of the buckles	4 2
to hang quite unattractively on the side.	4 3
If you 're	5
looking for rainboots,	5
definitely go for better ones than these.	5

B001RIYTK6-0009
This boots appeared great but too small.	7
I have always been a 8	7
but even with a very thin sock they were really tight.	7
Plus the insole was oversized	4
and would have to be trimmed.	4
I am disappointed	5
because they looked and felt like great boots.	3
Great price too	6
but BE AWARE.	5
The seller accepted a return	6
but I had to pay the shipping.	6
That cost a third of the price of the boot.	6
Also boots	5
sent in oversized mailing envelope	5
(which is destroyed	5
when opening),	5
would have been nice	5
if they had packed one in for a return.	5
I had to hunt for a box	5
to return in.	5
I would not deal with this seller again.	5

B001RIYTK6-0010
I love my red boots.	0
They are very sturdy	2
and keep the rain out.	8
They look good	3
and will last a long time	2
(long after red rubber boots go out of style, I'm sure).	2
My one complaint is	5
that they kind of smell	5
when I wear then indoors.	5
But this is obviously	5
because it's a rubber boot	4
and I shouldn't be wearing them for fashion indoors anyway.	4

B001RIYTK6-0013
I love the color and craftsmanship of this boot,	0 3
however it runs about a half size small.	7
I bought boot socks	5
to wear this	5
and there is no way	5
to fit them in and my feet too.	7
However my roommate	5
who is a half to full size smaller	7
says	5
it fits great for her.	1
So definitely order up!	5

B001RIYTK6-0016
What a great pair of boots,	5
not only are they cute but super comfortable and very durable.	1 3 2
I spent the night with our cub scout den on Alcatraz Island in San Francisco, lots of puddles and rain	8
most of one day my feet never hurt and never got wet...	8
and I looked cute!	3

B001RIYTK6-0018
Although some other reviews scared me	5
before buying this product,	5
I am very pleased with my new rain boots.	5
They fit very comfortably, even with thicker socks.	1
I really like the buckle	4 3
and think	3
it gives the boots some cute flair.	3
I definitely recommend this product to anyone	5
who wants to have high-quality rain boots	2
without paying an absurd about of money.	6

B004D3CFYE-0000
I purchased these hiking boots specifically	8
because they claimed to be waterproof.	8
The boot even has a little tag on the side	5
indicating so.	5
Apparently Merrell is very proud of it.	5
Long story short, they are anything but waterproof.	8
Even water-resistant would be too generous.	8
As my husband aptly put it,	5
porous is the term	8 4
that best describes the material.	4
Walking through dewy grass for more than a couple of minutes will leave your feet soaking wet.	8
The seams let water penetrate immediately,	8 4
which I found out	5
after walking through a shallow puddle.	5
The boot does not perform any better	8
at repelling water than my sandals.	8
It is that bad.	5
A complete waste of money	5
if you purchase these with the intention	5
of keeping your feet dry.	8

B004D3CFYE-0001
I bought these shoes from Comet shoes on amazon.com	5
and wore it 2 times	2
before the seam came apart from the sole.	2
All this after just 2 regular wears...	2
not even a strenuous hike!	5
I suspect	5
Comet shoes is are selling counterfeit products	5
because Merrell shoes are more reliable.	5
I would not be surprised	5
if other sellers are	5
following a similar practice.	5
I filed	5
a complain about this was told there's nothing	5
you can do	5
to help	5
because it's been 90 days since my purchase.	5
It's shameful	5
that they only look at the date of sale and not the usage	5
before making a refund decision.	5

B004D3CFYE-0004
I'm not crazy about these boots.	5
They are very uncomfortable in the foot bed.	1
I can't imagine wearing these shoes to go hiking in.	1
My feet would be killing me.	1
Sorry to say,	5
they went back.	5

B004D3CFYE-0007
These are extremely comfortable boots,	1
I did order a half size larger,	7
I love them ;	5
however, I bought them in February	5
and by April the inside fabric of the heel area of my right boot is torn	2
and falling apart.	2
Obviously, a poorly made shoe or inferior materials.	4 2

B004D3CFYE-0009
I have worn Merrell hiking boots for maybe 20 years.	5
This would be my fourth of fifth pair.	5
Although they are somewhat comfortable to wear for walking,	1
my feet hurt after short level ground hikes.	1
They rubbed on both sides of the toe area where my feet are wide	1
(and	5
why I buy Merrell boots).	5
I did not break them in and that could be a factor.	5
They are light weight and look good, but I am disappointed in the discomfort.	1 3 4

B004D3CFYE-0010
I liked these shoes for the fit and comfort.	1
They were waterproof at first,	8
but after wearing them for a few months they became quite leaky.	8 2
So	5
if you need something waterproof you	8
should probably look elsewhere.	5

B004D3CFYE-0015
I bought these shoes just before a trip to Niagara Falls	5
and had them shipped overnight.	5
Thank goodness	5
I read the suggestions by other reviewers	5
to order 1/2 size up bacause	7
these shoes definately run small.	1 7
I ordered a 9,	7
usually wear an 8?1/2,	7
and I could possibly have ordered a 9?1/2	7
because my toe is at the end of the shoe	1
(but not cramped enough for me	1
to be unable to wear them).	1
That	5
being said,	5
these shoes really are comfortable with no break in time required.	1
I took them straight out of the box	5
and wore them to walk all around Niagara Falls	1
without any discomfort.	1
And they are waterproof!!	8
I tested it by wearing them on the Maid of the Mist boat ride to the bottom of the falls.	5
I got soaked	8
but my feet stayed dry!!	8
I would definately recommend these shoes to anyone	5
and I 'm	5
considering getting another pair for myself!	5

B004D3CFYE-0019
I have hard to fit feet	5
since I need orthotics.	5
These are a little smaller	1 7
than I'd like,	1
but generally ok.	1
I like the heel support and the height is just right to provide support	1
without rubbing.	1
Mainly I need walking shoes	5
that are waterproof	8
and so far	5
they 've	5
been ok,	8
walking through wet grass,	8
although haven't had a chance	5
to try them in rain	8
(keeps raining at night!).	5
The color is nice, more light blue than purple.	0

B004D3CFYE-0036
These boots are awesome!	5
They are perfect for being on your feet all day	1
and are amazingly waterproof.	8
My feet NEVER get wet even when the outside of the boots are soaked.	8
I bought supports with them	5
initially because I have high arches	5
but I didn't even end up	5
needing them,	5
they provided adequate support themselves.	1
Definitely worth the money.	6

B004D3CFYE-0041
I've tried the shoes in stores	5
but neither had the size	5
I needed.	5
I was super delighted to discover	5
Amazon was selling a third color	0
(grey/blue) at the same price.	0 6
So with prime membership and tax-free, it was a done deal!	5
Also, you will need to buy a 0. 5 size bigger	7
if you want to have a little bit of room after hiking for hours.	1 7
Otherwise, the size	7
that you would normally wear	7
would be quite snug.	7
The shoes also needed to be broken into,	1
but I survived my first hike this past weekend with very minor blisters.	1
It's very sturdy and helped steady my ankles	1 2
(I rolled them a lot	5
when I just wore running shoes).	5
Great shoes for hiking in all kinds of weather,	8
that protects your feet	2
and keep them warm.	5
Thanks!	5

B004LLSV5U-0000
I was happy	5
when I purchased them,	5
but the first I stepped into a puddle [	8
not even deep enough	8
to cover all the boot] water ran into my foot.	8
Then I tried them in the snow	8
and my feet got really wet and cold.	8
I wish	5
I could return them now.	5

B004LLSV5U-0001
The boots in person don't have the same look as in the picture.	3
They are big shaft shoes!!	3
They are	4
made by two layers of thick fabric.	4
So if you want a pair of casual, very casual, boots	5
what is very very warm,	5
they may be	5
what you want.	5
It's because the way	5
it's constructed,	5
the shafts are narrow and very very hard to put on.	1 2
I tried to adjust with the shoe laces.	5
It ended up not able to maintain the look.	3

B004LLSV5U-0003
While they are very cute	3
(I love the color)	0
it's extremely hard	1
to get them on and off.	1
You have to unlace so much of the boot	5
to get into it...	5
and then of course, you have to lace it back up.	5
It takes too much time.	5
I wish	5
I would have bought a zip up.	5

B004LLSV5U-0004
I think	5
it should be told how small these boots are running	7
:) they are wonderful contructed boots but very small.	7 2
I have to get two size larger	7
to wear with a pair of socks!	7
not good	5

B004LLSV5U-0006
These boots are unbelievably gorgeous and blue is my favorite color.	0
I just wish	5
the heel piece wasn't so hard ;	4
it rubs the backs of my ankles raw	1
and I can not wear them but for so long.	1
They do have good ankle support however	1
which is important in icy conditions.	5
A good pair of boot socks or a shoe horn might be able to fix the ankle rubbing issue.	5
The boots are waterproof and fully lined ; very warm!	8

B004LLSV5U-0008
What I love about this boot is	5
how tall it is.	5
I live in the mountains in Colorado	5
and the snow gets deep	5
so I needed something tall.	5
Great color and good warmth.	0
What I do not like is	5
they are very difficult to slip on and take off.	1
It's like the jaws of life.	5
I tried them	5
without socks	5
and they slip on a little easier.	1
I will keep them in hoping	5
that they'll loosen up some.	5
Untying them doesn't help/work	5
as that is just part of the boots looks.	3
Maybe other buyers will have better luck.	5

B004LLSV5U-0010
These fit well	1
and they are comfortable.	1
I would recomend them for the all the snow	8
we have been	5
having in NY.	5
They only issue	5
I have it	5
that I didn't realize what a pain	5
it would be to lace them up.	5

B004LLSV5U-0018
Ordered these	5
because they were very much on sale	5
and would get here FAST!	5
We have snow pretty regularly	5
where I live,	5
and I like to have a range of snow boots to keep it interesting.	5
I am very impressed with the warmth of this boot.	8
Of course it takes a little time to lace up,	5
but it's not bad.	5
You 've	5
got to be prepared for cold, wet snow,	5
so why not spend a little time?	5
I'm usually a 7 but the 6. 5 fit fine.	7
These have a fairly good sole, good support, and of course great warmth, especially for synthetic insulating materials.	1 4
I'd give them 5 stars	5
if Timberland made them in the USA.	5

B004LLSV5U-0033
I am very excited to wear these books this winter.	5
They arrived quickly and without issues with the seller or the product.	5
They appear to be very well made	4 2
and are comfortable to wear around.	1
As someone	5
who loves slip on/no fuss shoes,	5
these are a little more time intensive to unlace/relace	5
(loosen)	5
to put on but they are snug	1
and I know	5
will keep my feet and legs dry and warm during the winter/snow/rain.	8

B004LLSV5U-0034
Wow!!!	5
This boots are so beautiful and comfortable.	1 3
I was so impressed how well are made.	2
The price was perfect for me.	6
I totally recommend the boots to anyone	5
who's looking for a great deal.	6

B004SAS28K-0009
For the amount of money I paid	6
one would expect to be able to at least put them on!	6 1
Fitflop has such great soles for the footwear	5
but these are so awkward to try to put on,	1
it requires a shoe horn	1
and bruises the top of the foot!	1
As I discarded the packing materials I am	5
keeping them	5
but will snip the stitching to at least be able to wear them.	1
Very disappointed.	5

B004SAS28K-0010
The size was right	7
but I couldn't get my foot	1 7
in because there was no easement like a zipper or elastic.	1 4
I was very disappointed	5
as I love	5
Fit Flop sandals and loved the style.	3
I had to return them.	5
I feel	5
you need to design these with a zipper.	4

B004SAS28K-0014
They were comfortable	1
once I finally got my foot in them,	1
but putting them on with socks was a task.	1
I had to have help	5
I guess	5
my foot was too wide from the bottom to the top of my ankle joint. they would have been perfect	1 7
if they had elastic or zipper on the side	4 1
to help with the foot going into the boot.	1

B004SAS28K-0021
This boot has nothing to unzip or anything flexible to make it possible to get the boot on your foot.	1 4
Ridiculous design.	5
The buckle is only for looks,	4 3
and you would assume	4
the inner ankle has an elastic insert.	4
You would be wrong.	4
You have to literally shove and push your foot into this boot in order to get it on.	1
The reason	5
I gave it two stars	5
is	5
that once its ON, its fine, and I love fitflops comfort.	1
Get ready to ruin your nails, work up a sweat,	1
and scratch up your fingers getting your foot into the things though.	1

B004SAS28K-0030
Sadly, I have printed off a return label	5
to send these back.	5
They came in,	5
they looked great, and they I tried to put them on...	3
With all those	5
saying how hard they were to get on,	5
I thought "	5
it shouldn't be a problem	5
". Wrong.	5
I couldn't even get them on to see how they looked	1
or fit	1
once my foot was in them!	1
They looked great,	3
I was excited for them,	5
but	5
if you can't get your foot it,	1
it's a waste.	1
I can't give them a 1	5
because they looked nice	3
and would surely have been comfortable,	1
but i couldn't get them on	1
and had to return them so no 5 either.	5

B004SAS28K-0047
The boot looks great.	3
But was unable to slip it on as there are no side zippers.	1 4
Probably i need to order it in a larger size.	7
I like a pair	1
that i can easily slip on and not struggle to put it on.	1
Would recommend getting 1 size larger.	7

B004SAS28K-0060
They are cozy warm and comfortable	1
just like the Fit Flops I wear all summer long.	1
The only problem	5
I have had with these	5
is trying to slide them	1
on when wearing socks.	1
There is friction with the suede inside	1 4
so they don't go on easily.	1 4
I need a shoe horn.	5
They are easy to slide off	1
but putting them on is difficult.	1
Still worth it though	5
once they are on.	5
They look great	3
and feel great.	1

B004SAS28K-0074
These are very comfortable.	1
As other reviewers have commented,	5
they can be hard to get on in the first week or so.	1
A tab in the back would help	4
but may be unsightly.	3
The comfort exceeds the slight hassle.	1
Last years version of this boot was a few inches taller	7
and I liked it a bit better.	7
This current style can look a little short	3 7
if you are	3 7
looking to tuck in skinny jeans.	3 7
Nonetheless, I will continue to buy FitFlops as long as they are	1
made because of the comfort.	1
If you plan to wear thick socks for added warmth	7
you may want to go up a half size if available.	7
These do not have a fuzzy warm interior.	4
I would not suggest wearing them in a heavy rain,	8
although have not had any issues	8
while wearing them	8
while running errands during wet rainy Pacific NW winter.	8

B004SAS28K-0085
I needed to replace my much loved Uggs.	5
I wanted extreme comfort & extreme ease	1
of wearing.	1
These boots have both.	1
The only thing	4
that could improve them	4
would be fleece inside.	4
I do kind of miss that.	5
True to size, soft suede especially on ankle area, superb FitFlop comfort	1 4 7
(I have been a Fit Flop Fan for many years now)	5
and casual,	3
go with everything looks make this	3
a great find.	3
I ususally don't shoe shop online,	5
but	5
since Amazon offered free returns,	5
I thought "	5
what the heck ".	5
I have returned about 80 % of the shoes	5
I ordered,	5
but FitFlops always fit first time!	1
You won't be disappointed!	5

B004SAS28K-0100
I like these boots,	5
I bought a pair last year on sale in a different color.	0
I waited	6
until the price was right	6
and ordered these,	6
they arrived the other day.	5
I had to go ONE SIZE DOWN in this style boot.	7
I know	7
that from ordering the size I	7
usually wear last year	7
and had to exchange them.	7
They are a little difficult	1
to get on the first few time,	1
but they do stretch	1 7
and they are just as comfy as all my other FITFLOPS.	1
I have a very nice collection.	5
I also have a thin foot.	5
If you have a wide foot,	7
these are NOT the boots for you.	7
They are cute with jeans and leggings.	3
Thanks!	5

B004UER758-0001
I hate these.	5
They do not fit well, are horribly uncomfortable	1
and make a squeaky noise no matter what type of floor you are walking on.	1
I used to be a big fan of MInnetonka	5
but I guess	5
it's not the 70	5
's anymore.	5
You would think	1
they would consider comfort	1
but I guess	1 3
they are only going for cute..	3

B004UER758-0003
The seam on the top of the foot sits too low and rubs against the top of the foot.	1
Tried multiple sizes and they all had the same seam issue.	1
Very cute	3
if you don't mind a little discomfort and blisters.	1 3
I returned them.	5
Not worth it to me.	5

B004UER758-0005
These were very narrow.	1 7
Will have to return them.	5
Was sad	5
that my 10 year old granddaughter's Christmas gift was a bust.	5
Such a beautiful moccasin but a shame they didn't seem true to size.	3 7

B004UER758-0007
I was super excited to get these	5
but after on the second day of use one of the metal buttons above the fringe broke off AND the zipper's leather tassel came undone,	2
when I tried to tie it back	2
it would stay tied as well.	2
The shoe its self is stylish,	3
but not good for an every day use. dont waste your money on these,	2
especially if you are looking for a shoe	2
to wear everyday!	2

B004UER758-0014
I ordered these in a 7?1/2	7
which I usually wear	7
but sent them back because too big.	7
A 7 was sent to me	7
but they are still too big,	7
I sould	7
have ordered a whole size down	7
but I didn't want to send back and wait more time to get them AGAIN!	5
They are awesome looking	3
and I do love them.	3
The ankle is a little too large	1 7
but that 's	5
because I'm petite.	5
I'd recommend these any day	5
but just be aware of the sizing.	7

B004UER758-0020
I wanted a true purple boot,	0
it was a washed purplish but not a true purple,	0
I am always a 9. 5	7
but they were a little long on me.	7
I think overall they were a nice look.	3

B004UER758-0042
Love the style and taupe color is perfect.	0 3
They are a comfortable fit on width, but a little long in length.	1 7
Normally a 9 fits perfect,	7
but this is a tab long.	7
I've worn them	5
and it's not an issue.	5
Well made and just something different to wear.	2

B004UER758-0044
I was looking for something comfy	1
that would work for fall --	1
these boots are very nice, well made,	1
but,	5
as other reviewers have pointed out : Narrow.	7
My feet are medium width,	7
and these moccasins were tight.	1 7
They have stretched a little,	5
but here's the thing -	5
the bottom tread is cut to this narrow width.	7
Otherwise, nice,	5
but maybe get a size or half size up	7
and fill in with thick socks	7
to make them fit.	1 7

B004UER758-0078
These boots are really cute and great quality.	3
I love wearing them with skinny jeans or with tights and a dress.	5
I am usually a size 6 and so I ordered a size 6.	7
They are too big even with heavy socks,	7
so I'd say size down a half or maybe even full size.	7
I decided to keep mine	7
even though they are too big though -	7
the sizing issue doesn't give me any problems	1 7
since they are flats,	1
and being booties are secure around the ankle.	1
When I got them,	5
the fringe was all crazy and going in every which direction,	4 3
but I just smoothed down the fringe,	4 3
laid the boots on their side	3
and rested some heavy books on top of them for a few days.	3
After that, they looked better, and then	3
the fringe also just naturally calmed down with time.	4 3
Great buy - love Minnetonka!	5

B004UER758-0084
Minnetonka makes the best moccasins	5
you can buy!	5
The colour is beautiful	0
the attention to detail is great!	3
So well made so very comfortable!	1 2
I get tons of compliments	5
when I wear them!	5
I really love	5
that this is a limited edition item	5
and	5
when they are gone	5
they are gone	5
and I got them!	5
I love the colour plum	0
and it's nice to know	5
that my boots are special!	5

B008BG2IM8-0000
I ordered these shoes in a wide size,	7
but found	5
that after only about an hour my toes were completely numb.	1
Normally ordering my size in a wide works very well,	7
but not with this shoe.	7
It is painful!	1
I actually wound up wearing my sneakers for the rest of the day at work.	5
Not good!	5
With that said,	5
I have these remaining things to share about this shoe :	5
First, I recommend not ordering these	5
if you have wide feet -	5
they are NOT wide.	5
Second,	5
they seem	5
like they fit a little `` short '' ;	1
if you have narrow feet	5
and still want to try them,	5
I recommend you try 1/2 size up.	7
Third, the shoes seem	2
well made	2
and appear to be decent quality.	2
However, that was not enough	5
to make up for my suffering.	5
I do not recommend this shoe or this brand,	5
to be honest.	5
Get on the ball Naturalizer ;	5
I expected more from you!	5

B008BG2IM8-0001
The shoes	5
I ordered	5
were labeled as 10W,	7
but there is no way	7
this shoe is a wide width.	7
I have several pairs of shoes in this style	5
that are wide width	5
and they all fit fine right out of the box.	5
This shoe company needs to assess	5
all their shoes labeled wide width	5
and mark them to USA shoe size standards	5
so they're labeled properly	5
so their customers aren't wasting their time with returning shoes	5
that don't fit.	1

B008BG2IM8-0002
The reviews had said a little narrow.	7
Because I am not a big person,	5
I thought	5
that would work for me.	5
After wearing them for 20 minutes,	1
I could not wear them another second longer.	1
They killed my feet!	1
I won't bother trying to find the right fit at this point,	5
I will go with other brands	5
I know better.	5
I loved the look and color	0 3
so I am disappointed	5
they didn't fit properly.	1

B008BG2IM8-0003
I ordered these a half-size up	7
and they still fit poorly.	1
I wear an average-width size	5
8. 5	5
and I'm not sure	5
whose foot these were intended to fit.	5
I rarely have problems with the size of shoes	5
I order online.	5
The toe box is quite narrow,	1
which is a problem for shoes with a heel of this height.	5
They also look cheap,	3
which I guess	5
they are,	5
but the picture is misleading.	5
I am wondering	5
if they are worth returning or just passing off to someone with narrow feet.	5
I don't think I know anyone	5
who would wear these anyway.	5

B008BG2IM8-0004
I absolutely love the style	3
and wish they fit right.	1
At first I thought	5
they were just a little snug	1
and they didnt ' hurt.	1
Once the weather got cold the shoes became more stiff and they really hurt now	1
so it looks like I wasted $ 40.	5

B008BG2IM8-0007
I thought	5
the taupe would look like the picture.	3
It does n't.	3
What I received is a grayish brown shoe.	0
I am consistently a size 8 medium shoe.	5
This shoe is snug	1
and my toes	1
hurt after a wearing the shoes a few hours.	1
Since this isn't a leather shoe,	4
it won't adjust to my feet	1
and so will always be just a bit too snug.	1
Although, not excessively small, I would suggest	7
going down a half size.	7
I wear a thin trouser sock with this shoe	5
and it's still too small.	7

B008BG2IM8-0010
These shoes are very comfortable and cute.	1 3
However, I would order one size larger than normal.	7
I usually wear	5
a B width and these are very narrow.	7
You'll get blisters	1
if you don't wear socks with them	1
because they're so narrow.	1 7
I ordered a half size larger	7
and they were still a little tight.	1 7
They're very good quality.	4 2

B008BG2IM8-0013
I agree with the other reviewers...	5
these run a little narrow.	7
But get the size right and these are awesome.	7
Lots of compliments and the stretchy band helps with the fit	1
--	5
after a few days of breaking them in I can wear them comfortably all day.	1
They look great with jeans -- super cute!	3
I would recommend ordering the wide in your normal shoe size	7
or go up a half size	7
if you normally wear a wide shoe.	7
The soft pillow cushion, wide heel, and soft-arch make them the perfect all-day shoe.	1 4

B008BG2IM8-0015
I am actually wearing these shoes today.	5
They are much more comfortable than some of my other heels of similar design and height.	1
The insoles are quite cushioned	1
and they look and feel great.	1 3
Love them!	5

B008BG2IM8-0016
This is definitely a comfortable shoe.	1
Fits perfect and the insole is soft	1 4
and feels great on my feet.	1
I wear a size 10?1/2	7
I chose size 11.	7
And it fits perfect.	1
Definitely would recommend this shoe,	5
looks sleek, dressy,	3
not to high with the heel, and great with jeans.	3
Love them!	5

B00EFD6B8I-0000
At first I loved	5
them!!	5
Wore them all the time.	5
Then one night about 3 weeks	5
after I got them the heel collapsed.	2
My friend looked at the heel	5
and it was a hollow heel.	4
No support in the heel.	4 2
Very disappointed in my purchase.	5

B00EFD6B8I-0001
These boots are so cute,	3
but the sole is made of a cheap material	4
and walking in them is squishes down a little...	5
I've worn mine about 10 times	5
and the heels of the shoes are falling apart.	2
I noticed	5
when I first wore them	5
that the heel squishes down	2
as you walk	5
and after the first few times it split open.	2
Ended up getting some shoe goo	5
and filling the entire heel with it	5
because the heel is hollow on the shoes.	4 2
Cute but terrible quality	4 3
if you walk like a normal person...	5

B00EFD6B8I-0003
These boots are adorable	3
and they fit perfectly.	1
I usually wear a 9?1/2	7
and ordered a 10	7
since there wasn't an option for the half size.	7
They fit great	1 7
and are pretty comfortable too.	1
However, I've worn them out three times and don't think	2
I will ever wear them again.	2
The heel is made of cheep rubber and deflates	4 2
when I walk.	5
So if i'm walking on my tip-toes	5
and don't put pressure on my heels	5
they're okay	5
but if I walk normally at all,	5
they deflate and make an annoying squish sound.	5
Very disappointed in the quality of these.	2

B00EFD6B8I-0007
Very cute boots.	3
Matched my motorcycle jacket perfectly.	3
Very uncomfortable and feet	1
hurt after 30 minutes	1
of wearing	5
while sitting on sofa.	5
Very hard insole	4
that needs more cushion.	4
Great price	6

B00EFD6B8I-0008
I was excited to receive these boots.	5
The color was exactly	0
was	0
I was looking for.	0
They are a little shorter	7
than I thought	5
they'd be.	5
Also the left one is much bigger than the right.	7
I have never had a problem like this with shoes,	5
not ever.	5
I was a little disappointed.	5
I still wear them just not as often.	5

B00EFD6B8I-0011
They are adorable	3
and look good	3
but are made of very cheap material.	4
I would recommend getting more than one pair	2
or buying higher quality boots	2
if you plan	2
on wearing them every day.	2
One good scrape and the black would come off.	2
I do like them	5
but I'm being honest about the quality.	5
I have yet to have an issue with the heel	2
collapsing but after reading other reviews got a tube of shoe goo in case	5
it happens.	5
They seem pretty solid to me.	2
These are going to be awesome for date nights with my husband but not something	5
that would stand up to much more than that.	5

B00EFD6B8I-0015
These boots are exactly as pictured.	3
They are very light weight & fairly comfortable.	1
Obviously, these boots aren't made to wear daily, but more so	2
to wear with that " perfect outfit " here & there.	5
The boots are grey,	3
which I was pleasantly surprised because other boots	5
I 've	5
tried to get	5
that coloring will show up charcoal or silver.	5
The color & style is wonderful!	0 3
I do love them!	5

B00EFD6B8I-0023
I bought these boots for a Halloween costume,	5
but loved them so much	5
that I wear them frequently.	5
I got the color " Tan "	0
which looks exactly as pictured on the website.	0
I ordered a size 9,	7
and I would say	5
they're just slightly too large in the foot area,	1 7
but nothing a pair of fuzzy socks won't fix.	5
My only problem with these boots is	5
that the heel is too soft.	5
Either the rubber	4
they used	5
has too much give in it,	4
or the heels are hollow, or SOMETHING.	4
If you walk hard on your heels,	5
the heel of the boot kind of gives in.	2
Honestly, it's not a big enough problem	5
for me to not wear them.	5
Otherwise, they are AMAZINGLY comfortable.	1
I've worn these all day while working retail,	1
and my feet were perfectly comfortable.	1

B00EFD6B8I-0025
I love	5
these boots,	5
if you are looking for cowgirl boots	5
that wont cost an arm and a leg,	6
look no farther!	5
I have a couple different pairs of these,	5
and they go with anything!	3
I wear them with jeans and dresses!	5
Very comfy and stylish.	1 3
Size it true to fit also!	7
I wear between a 7 and a half and an 8.	7
I ordered a size 8 just in case	7
and they fit perfect!	1 7

B00EFD6B8I-0026
I bought this set for my first ever country concert!	5
I did not want to spend a lot of money on boots,	6
so	5
when I saw these,	5
I decided to give a try.	5
The shipping was fast	5
and they look exactly like the picture.	3
The fit is great too, very comfortable.	1
I am not use to wearing high heels or anything like that	5
so these were a perfect fit.	1
I have worn them a couple of times,	5
and they feel super comfy!	1
I wore them for more than a few hours	1
and my feet felt just fine.	1
If you do not want to spend a lot of money on boots,	6
I highly recommend these, not only are they affordable, but very comfortable!!	6 1
